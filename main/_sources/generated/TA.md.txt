(Note: The guidance, evidence, confidence scoring and checklist sections below are copied from [CodeThink's documentation of TSF](https://codethinklabs.gitlab.io/trustable/trustable/trustable/TA.html). However, the answers to each point in the evidence list and checklist are specific to this project.)

**Guidance**

This assertion is satisfied to the extent that test data, and data collected
from monitoring of deployed versions of nlohmann/json, has been analysed, and the results
used to inform the refinement of Expectations and risk analysis.

The extent of the analysis is with sufficient precision to confirm that:

- all Expectations (TA-BEHAVIOURS) are met
- all Misbehaviours (TA-MISBEHAVIOURS) are detected or mitigated
- all advance warning indicators (TA-INDICATORS) are monitored
- failure rates (calculated directly or inferred by statistics) are
  within acceptable tolerance

When tests reveal Misbehaviours missing from our analysis (TA-ANALYSIS), we update our Expectations (TA-BEHAVIOURS, TA-MISBEHAVIOURS).
Guided by confidence evaluations (TA-CONFIDENCE), we refine and repeat the analysis as needed.
Analysis results also inform confidence evaluations, allowing automatic generation through statistical modelling and defining Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for consistent use across the TSF.

For increased confidence in the analysis specification and results, they should be evaluated in terms of their reliability, relevance, and understandability.

- Reliability: The analysis methods must be verified against both known good and bad data to ensure sufficient detection of false negatives and false positives.
  Accuracy degradation across methods should be tracked and aggregated, making outcomes more easily verifiable and providing visibility into how changes to the system under test or to the analysis mechanisms affect the results.
- Relevance: The results must account for hardware and hardware/software interactions.
  Calibration should address capacity, scalability, response time, latency, and throughput where applicable.
  To further increase confidence in estimated failure rates, the analysis should also cover testing sufficiency (with statistical methods where appropriate), cascading failures including sequencing and concurrency, bug analysis, and comparison against expected results and variability. 
  The analysis should be automated and exercised repeatedly for timely feedback.
- Understandability: Both methods and results should be mapped to other analyses performed on the system (linked to TT_EXPECTATIONS) to ensure alignment with scope, abstraction levels, and partitioning, thereby guiding prioritisation.
  Effectiveness also depends on user-friendliness and presentation (involving semi-formal structured forms, supported by diagrams and figures with clear legends).

To gain increased confidence, test results should be shown to be reproducible. 
Even with non-deterministic software, representative test setups must be ensured to produced reproducible results
within a defined threshold as specified by TT-EXPECTATIONS.
Reproducible test results also supports verification of toolchain updates (together with other measures in TA-FIXES),
by confirming that test results remain unchanged when no changes are intended.

**Evidence**

- Analysis of test data, including thresholds in relation to appropriate statistical properties.
  - **Answer**: The analysis of test data is captured by JLS-17, but no explicit quantitative thresholds are defined.
- Analysis of failures
  - **Answer**: Provided by JLS-26 and JLS-17.
- Analysis of spikes and trends
  - **Answer**: CI test failure rates for the upstream `nlohmann/json` repository and `eclipse-score/inc_nlohmann_json` are analysed using the time-series based GitHub Actions metrics views. This analysis is performed manually (see JLS-17). There is currently no fully automated, continuous analysis of failures.
- Validation of analysis methods used
  - **Answer**: There is no separate formal validation of the analysis methods.

**Confidence scoring**

Confidence scoring for TA-ANALYSIS is based on KPIs
that may indicate problems in development, test, or production.

**CHECKLIST**

- What fraction of Expectations are covered by the test data?
  - **Answer**: The two expectations are JLEX-01 and JLEX-02. Every statement supporting either of these expectations is ultimately supported by a test, except for WFJ-06. WFJ-06 specifies that `basic_json::accept` must accept exactly JSON values for all possible inputs. Since there are infinitely many possible inputs, this cannot be tested exhaustively. Indirect tests are provided by the rejection of ill-formed json data.
- What fraction of Misbehaviours are covered by the monitored indicator data?
  - **Answer**: Currently none, because there is no implemented monitoring of deployed instances yet. This is a future integrator responsibility (see AOU-09, AOU-18 and AOU-19).
- How confident are we that the indicator data are accurate and timely?
  - **Answer**: No indicator data is collected (see the previous question).
- How reliable is the monitoring process?
  - **Answer**: See the previous question.
- How well does the production data correlate with our test data?
  - **Answer**: There are no production data.
- Are we publishing our data analysis?
  - **Answer**: Analyses of CI tests failure rates are published in the TSF documentation on GitHub (via ci_failure_rate_analysis.md), but there is currently no published analysis of production monitoring data.
- Are we comparing and analysing production data vs test?
  - **Answer**: There is no production data.
- Are our results getting better, or worse?
  - **Answer**: There are no explicit quantitative trends that indicate whether results are improving or degrading over time.
- Are we addressing spikes/regressions?
  - **Answer**: There is currently no monitored indicator data, so spikes in indicator trends are not tracked. However, any failing tests in CI are investigated and fixed, and fuzz-testing results in the original nlohmann/json repository are analysed and addressed.
- Do we have sensible/appropriate target failure rates?
  - **Answer**: No explicit numeric failure-rate targets are defined. The implicit target is that the CI test suite passes and known misbehaviours remain within an acceptable, manually monitored range.
- Do we need to check the targets?
  - **Answer**: For unit and integration tests, there are no explicit failure rate targets. The implicit target is that the CI test suite passes on all supported environments, which is continuously checked by the CI workflows (see JLS-26). Since the fuzz testing runs and is investigated in the original nlohmann/json repository, there is no need to check the target.
- Are we achieving the targets?
  - **Answer**: For the unit and integration tests, yes. The degree of target achievement for the fuzz-testing is evaluated within the original nlohmann/json repository.
- Are all underlying assumptions and target conditions for the analysis specified?
  - **Answer**: For all tests, the underlying assumption and target condition is that they should cover all expectations, and that no test is expected to fail. Any failed tests are analyzed and reasonably justified or fixed.
- Have the underlying assumptions been verified using known good data?
  - **Answer**:  The input data from [nlohmann/json_test_data](https://github.com/nlohmann/json_test_data/tree/master) which is used for the tests contain both known good data and known bad data. As each expectation is mapped to a sub-set of tests, it is indeed verified that the underlying assumption is reasonably verified.
- Has the Misbehaviour identification process been verified using known bad data?
  - **Answer**: Yes. The misbehaviour identification process has been exercised using known bad data from [nlohmann/json_test_data](https://github.com/nlohmann/json_test_data/tree/master)
- Are results shown to be reproducible?
  - **Answer**: A dedicated ci_reproducible_tests target exists to run a reproducible subset of tests, but not all tests are fully reproducible (see JLS-62).

(Note: The guidance, evidence, confidence scoring and checklist sections below are copied from [CodeThink's documentation of TSF](https://codethinklabs.gitlab.io/trustable/trustable/trustable/TA.html). However, the answers to each point in the evidence list and checklist are specific to this project.)

Although it is practically impossible to specify all of the necessary behaviours
and required properties for complex software, we must clearly specify the most
important of these (e.g. where harm could result if given criteria are not met),
and verify that these are correctly provided by nlohmann/json.

**Guidance**

This assertion is satisfied to the extent that we have:

- Determined which Behaviours are critical for consumers of nlohmann/json and recorded
  them as Expectations.
- Verified these Behaviours are achieved.

Expectations could be verified by:

- Functional testing for the system.
- Functional soak testing for the system.
- Specifying architecture and verifying its implementation with pre-merge
  integration testing for components.
- Specifying components and verifying their implementation using pre-merge unit
  testing.

The number and combination of the above verification strategies will depend on
the scale of the project. For example, unit testing is more suitable for the
development of a small library than an OS. 
Similarly, the verification strategy must align with the chosen development
methods and be supported by appropriate verification approaches and tools.

Regardless of the chosen strategy, the reasoning behind it must be recorded in a
traceable way, linking breakdown and verification methods to the relevant
reasoning, abstraction levels, and design partitioning (including system
interfaces with users and hardware, or other system boundaries).

Finally, the resulting system must be validated, with the foundation of
validation being a working system that has appropriately considered calibration
targets such as capacity, scalability, response time, latency, and throughput,
where applicable.
Without this, specification and verification efforts cannot be considered
sufficient.

**Evidence**

- List of Expectations
  - **Answer**: 
- Argument of sufficiency for break-down of expected behaviour for all 
  Expectations
  - **Answer**: 
- Validation and verification of expected behaviour
  - **Answer**: 


**Confidence scoring**

Confidence scoring for TA-BEHAVIOURS is based on our confidence that the list of
Expectations is accurate and complete, that Expectations are verified by tests,
and that the resulting system and tests are validated by appropriate strategies.

**Checklist**

- How has the list of Expectations varied over time?
  - **Answer**: 
- How confident can we be that this list is comprehensive?
  - **Answer**: 
- Could some participants have incentives to manipulate information?
  - **Answer**: 
- Could there be whole categories of Expectations still undiscovered?
  - **Answer**: 
- Can we identify Expectations that have been understood but not specified?
  - **Answer**: 
- Can we identify some new Expectations, right now?
  - **Answer**: 
- How confident can we be that this list covers all critical requirements?
  - **Answer**: 
- How comprehensive is the list of tests?
  - **Answer**: 
- Is every Expectation covered by at least one implemented test?
  - **Answer**: 
- Are there any Expectations where we believe more coverage would help?
  - **Answer**: 
- How do dependencies affect Expectations, and are their properties verifiable?
  - **Answer**: 
- Are input analysis findings from components, tools, and data considered in relation to Expectations?

(Note: The guidance, evidence, confidence scoring and checklist sections below are copied from [CodeThink's documentation of TSF](https://codethinklabs.gitlab.io/trustable/trustable/trustable/TA.html). However, the answers to each point in the evidence list and checklist are specific to this project.)

**Guidance**

To quantify confidence, either a subjective assessment or a statistical argument must be presented for each statement and then systematically and repeatably aggregated to assess whether the final deliverable is fit for purpose.

To improve the accuracy of confidence evaluations in reflecting reality, the following steps are necessary:

- Break down high-level claims into smaller, recursive requests.
- Provide automated evaluations whenever possible, and rely on subjective assessments from appropriate parties when automation is not feasible.
- Aggregate confidence scores from evidence nodes.
- Continuously adjust prior confidence measures with new evidence, building on established values.

Any confidence scores, whether tracked manually or statistically, must be based on documented review guidelines that are themselves reviewed and applied by appropriate parties.
These guidelines should focus on detecting inconsistencies in the reasoning and evidence linked to related Expectations, and on assessing the relevancy of all aspects considered.
As a result, the argument structure must reflect the project scope, which in turn should be captured in the set Expectations and linked to the project’s analysis, design considerations, and partitioning.
Within this structure, Statements must be ordered or weighted so that their relative importance and supporting reasoning are clear, with iteration scores capturing strengths and weaknesses and guiding decisions.

As subjective assessments are replaced with statistical arguments and confidence scores are refined with new evidence, evaluation accuracy improves.
Over time, these scores reveal the project's capability to deliver on its objectives.
The process itself should be analysed to determine score maturity, with meta-analysis used to assess long-term trends in sourcing, accumulation, and weighting.

**Evidence**

- Confidence scores from other TA items
  - **Answer**: Provided in JLS-08, JLS-09 and JLS-37

**Confidence scoring**

Confidence scoring for TA-CONFIDENCE is based on quality of the confidence
scores given to Statements

**Checklist**

- What is the algorithm for combining/comparing the scores?
  - **Answer**: The algorithm behind the scoring in given in JLS-09
- How confident are we that this algorithm is fit for purpose?
  - **Answer**: We are confident that the scoring algorithm is fit for purpose and is aligned with the TSF methodology described (see also JLS-09). However, at the moment, the statements require a larger number of SME reviewers to profit from the law-of-large-numbers and arrive at statistically significant scores.
- What are the trends for each score?
  - **Answer**: At the moment, there are no trends as all statements have the review-status 'unreviewed'. However, the infrastructure for saving history of scores is already in place (see JLS-20).
- How well do our scores correlate with external feedback signals?
  - **Answer**: Such correlation can not be measured yet due to missing data.

(Note: The guidance, evidence, confidence scoring and checklist sections below are copied from [CodeThink's documentation of TSF](https://codethinklabs.gitlab.io/trustable/trustable/trustable/TA.html). However, the answers to each point in the evidence list and checklist are specific to this project.)

**Guidance**

Constraints on reuse, reconfiguration, modification, and deployment are
specified to enhance the trustability of outputs. To ensure clarity, boundaries
on what the output cannot do - especially where common domain assumptions may
not hold - must be explicitly documented. These constraints are distinct from
misbehaviour mitigations; instead, they define the context within which the
system is designed to operate, including all modes and environmental
considerations. This upfront documentation clarifies intended use, highlights
known limitations, and prevents misinterpretation.

These constraints, categorised into explicit limitations and assumptions of use,
guide both stakeholders and users (integrators, maintainers, operators, and
end-users). They define the intended scope and provide a clear interface for how
upstream and downstream systems can integrate, modify, install, reuse, or
reconfigure to achieve the desired output. The documentation must also specify
the contexts in which the integrity of existing Statements is preserved and
whether reimplementation is required, considering device maintenance
assumptions, including software updates and vulnerability mitigation.

Crucially, these limitations are not unresolved defects from triage decisions
but deliberate exclusions based on design choices. Each omission should be
supported by a clear rationale (linked to relevant Expectations and analyses 
with the appropriate architectural and abstraction levels) to ensure
transparency for future scope expansion and to guide both upstream and
downstream modifications.

To remain effective in practice, constraints must consider user-friendliness in
relation to associated Misbehaviours (TA-MISBEHAVIOURS) and AWIs
(TA-INDICATORS):

- Include mechanisms to prevent misuse (e.g., protecting runtime parameters from
  corruption or unauthorized modification during both development and
  operation), explicitly linking them to relevant Misbehaviours and their
  analyses (as defined in TA-MISBEHAVIOURS).
- Present constraint-related data with emphasis on availability, clarity, and
  transparent communication of defined safe states, along with the mechanisms
  that transition the system into those states, ensuring they are connected to
  the relevant AWIs (as defined in TA-INDICATORS).

Finally, the documentation must establish and promote a clear process for
reporting bugs, issues, and requests.

**Suggested evidence**

- Installation manuals with worked examples
  - **Answer**: 
- Configuration manuals with worked examples
  - **Answer**: 
- Specification documentation with a clearly defined scope
  - **Answer**: 
- User guides detailing limitations in interfaces designed for expandability or
  modularity
  - **Answer**: 
- Documented strategies used by external users to address constraints and
  work with existing Statements
  - **Answer**: 

**Confidence scoring**

The reliability of these constraints should be assessed based on the absence of
contradictions and obvious pitfalls within the defined Statements.

**Checklist**

- Are the constraints grounded in realistic expectations, backed by real-world
  examples?
  - **Answer**: 
- Do they effectively guide downstream consumers in expanding upon existing
  Statements?
  - **Answer**: 
- Do they provide clear guidance for upstreams on reusing components with
  well-defined claims?
  - **Answer**: 
- Are any Statements explicitly designated as not reusable or adaptable?
  - **Answer**: 
- Are there worked examples from downstream or upstream users demonstrating
  these constraints in practice?
  - **Answer**: 
- Have there been any documented misunderstandings from users, and are these
  visibly resolved?
  - **Answer**: 
- Do external users actively keep up with updates, and are they properly
  notified of any changes?
  - **Answer**:

However, the answers to each point in the evidence list and checklist are specific to this project.)

**Guidance**

This assertion is satisfied if results from all tests and monitored deployments are captured accurately, ensuring:

- Sufficient precision for meaningful analysis
- Enough contextual information to reproduce the setup (e.g., runner ID, software version SHA), though not necessarily the exact results

Monitored deployments run in both production and development, validating monitoring mechanisms across environments and ensuring comparable results.
Collecting and retaining all data that support project claims (together with traceability to reasoning and specifications, and including both established and experimental indicators as well as test data from all environments) preserves evidence for selecting appropriate measures and enables historical analysis.

To avoid misinterpretation, all data storage mechanisms and locations are documented, together with long-term storage strategies, so analyses can be reliably reproduced.
How this data is made accessible is assessed as part of TA-ITERATIONS.

Storage strategies should account for foreseeable malicious activities and privacy considerations when handling sensitive data, including how the data is managed during transit and at rest, and whether it can be accessed in plaintext or only through appropriate tools (also considered for TA-INPUTS and TA-TESTS).

Appropriate storage strategies safeguard availability across the product lifecycle, with emphasis on release-related data, and account for decommissioning, infrastructure teardown, and post-project backups.

**Evidence**

- Time-stamped and traceable result records for each test execution, linked to associated system under test version and specification references.
  - **Answer**: Provided by JLS-18 and JLS-45.
- List of monitored indicators, linked to associated specification version references.
  - **Answer**: Runtime monitoring indicators for deployed instances are not yet implemented and are expected to be defined by the integrator (see AOU-09, AOU-18 and AOU-19).
- Time-stamped and traceable test-derived data for each indicator, linked to associated system under test version and indicator specifications references.
  - **Answer**: Indicator-level data is not yet collected and should be done by the integrator (see AOU-09).
- List of monitored deployments, linked to associated version and configuration references.
  - **Answer**: Not available. Monitoring of deployed instances should be specified by the integrator (see AOU-09, AOU-18 and AOU-19).
- Time-stamped and traceable production data for each indicator, linked to associated deployment metadata and specification references.
  - **Answer**: Not available. Should be done by the integrator (see AOU-09, AOU-18 and AOU-19).

**Confidence scoring**

Confidence scoring for TA-DATA quantifies the completeness of test results
(including pass/fail and performance) and the availability of data from all
monitored deployments.

**Checklist**

- Is all test data stored with long-term accessibility?
  - **Answer**: No. Test results are collected into a persistent database as part of the CI workflows, which is done as a proof of concept. Due to GitHub storage constraints, the storage of this database is currently limited.
- Is all monitoring data stored with long-term accessibility?
  - **Answer**: No. Dedicated monitoring data from deployed software is not collected yet. But it is expected to be implemented by the integrator (see AOU-09, AOU-18 and AOU-19).
- Are extensible data models implemented?
  - **Answer**: Test-result data is stored in a SQLite database with separate tables for workflow runs and individual test results (see JLS-18). This schema can be extended with additional fields or tables if needed.
- Is sensitive data handled correctly (broadcasted, stored, discarded, or anonymised) with appropriate encryption and redundancy?
  - **Answer**: This is not explicitly applicable. The captured test data does not include personal or sensitive data.
- Are proper backup mechanisms in place?
  - **Answer**: No explicit project-level backup mechanism is defined for the test results database beyond GitHub’s own infrastructure.
- Are storage and backup limits tested?
  - **Answer**: The `capture_test_data_memory_sensitive.py` script enforces size limits for the persistent database and fails the workflow if they are exceeded. There is no backup mechanism.
- Are all data changes traceable?
  - **Answer**:  Yes, for test data. Updates to `TSF/MemoryEfficientTestResultData.db` are performed by CI workflows and committed to the `save_historical_data` branch, so Git history records each change.
- Are concurrent changes correctly managed and resolved?
  - **Answer**: Largely yes for test data. The ubuntu workflow uses a concurrency group that cancels in-progress runs for the same reference, so typically only one job updates the persistent database at a time and remaining conflicts would surface as failed pushes and require manual resolution.
- Is data accessible only to intended parties?
  - **Answer**: Since the library is open source, there are no unintended parties.
- Are any subsets of our data being published?
  - **Answer**: Yes, as a proof of concept, CI test result data is committed to the `save_historical_data` branch in the SQLite database `TSF/MemoryEfficientTestResultData.db`, which is publicly accessible via this GitHub repository.

(Note: The guidance, evidence, confidence scoring and checklist sections below are copied from [CodeThink's documentation of TSF](https://codethinklabs.gitlab.io/trustable/trustable/trustable/TA.html). However, the answers to each point in the evidence list and checklist are specific to this project.)

**Guidance**

This assertion is satisfied to the extent that we have identified, triaged, and applied fixes or mitigations to faults in nlohmann/json, as well as to bugs and publicly disclosed vulnerabilities identified in upstream dependencies.

Confidence can be improved by assessing known faults, bugs, and vulnerabilities to establish their relevance and impact for nlohmann/json.
An important aspect is documenting how issues are discovered and tracked, including identifying additional Misbehaviours (TA-MISBEHAVIOURS) that may require immediate mitigation measures (including recalls), and how such issues are communicated to users.

In principle, this analysis should include not only the code in nlohmann/json but also its dependencies (all the way down) and the tools and data used to construct the release.
In practice, however, the cost/benefit of this work must be weighed against:

- the volume and quality of available bug and vulnerability reports
- the likelihood that our build, configuration, or use case is actually affected

The triage process must be documented, reviewed, and evidenced as sufficient and consistently followed.
Documentation must make clear how prioritisation, assignment, and rejection (e.g., for duplicates) are handled, and how mitigations are tracked to completion in a timely manner appropriate to the project's claims and the issues discovered.

Field incidents are a key source of high-priority Misbehaviours.
These require additional rigour to ensure appropriate and timely responses.
For every iteration and associated change, related issue resolutions must be documented with their impact (e.g., whether new Misbehaviours were found or parts of the analysis had to be redone) and linked to the specific change, ensuring visible traceability.
This information must remain available to support decision traceability throughout the project's lifetime (as considered in TA-DATA).

As part of ongoing monitoring, the rate of incoming, resolved, and rejected issues across the project and its dependencies should be tracked for trends and anomalies, to identify shifts and to detect if a source of information is lost.

**Evidence**

- List of known bugs fixed since last release
  - **Answer**: Provided in JLS-29
- List of outstanding bugs still not fixed, with triage/prioritisation based
  on severity/relevance/impact
  - **Answer**: Provided in JLS-28 and JLS-11
- List of known vulnerabilities fixed since last release
  - **Answer**: Provided in JLS-29
- List of outstanding known vulnerabilities still not fixed, with triage/prioritisation based
  on severity/relevance/impact
  - **Answer**: Provided in JLS-30, JLS-33 and AOU-29
- List of nlohmann/json component versions, showing where a newer version exists upstream
  - **Answer**: Not relevant since nlohmann/json has no external components, as stated in JLS-34
- List of component version updates since last release
  - **Answer**: Not relevant as nlohmann/json has no external components, as stated in JLS-34
- List of fixes applied to developed code since last release
  - **Answer**: Provided in JLS-29
- List of fixes for developed code that are outstanding, not applied yet
  - **Answer**: Provided in JLS-11
- List of nlohmann/json faults outstanding (O)
  - **Answer**: Provided in JLS-11
- List of nlohmann/json faults fixed since last release (F)
  - **Answer**: Provided in JLS-29
- List of nlohmann/json faults mitigated since last release (M)
  - **Answer**: Provided in JLS-29

**Confidence scoring**

Confidence scoring for TA-FIXES can be based on

- some function of [O, F, M] for nlohmann/json
- number of outstanding relevant bugs from components
- bug triage results, accounting for undiscovered bugs
- number of outstanding known vulnerabilities
- triage results of publicly disclosed vulnerabilities, accounting for undiscovered bugs and vulnerabilities
- confidence that known fixes have been applied
- confidence that known mitigations have been applied
- previous confidence score for TA-FIXES

Each iteration, we should improve the algorithm based on measurements

**Checklist**

- How many faults have we identified in nlohmann/json?
  - **Answer**: 58, but none are relevant for S-CORE's use case of the library (see JLS-11).
- How many unknown faults remain to be found, based on the number that have
  been processed so far?
  - **Answer**: It is unlikely that there are unknown faults relevant to S-CORE.
- Is there any possibility that people could be motivated to manipulate the
  lists (e.g. bug bonus or pressure to close).
  - **Answer**: It is unlikely that people would be motivated to manipulate the lists in nlohmann/json. The nlohmann/json project has no bug bounties, and since it is open source, third party individuals suggest fixes with no pressure/incentive to manipulate unfixed issues.
- How many faults may be unrecorded (or incorrectly closed, or downplayed)?
  - **Answer**: Few or none, considering the wide use of the nlohmann/json library (see JLS-05).
- How do we collect lists of bugs and known vulnerabilities from components?
  - **Answer**: We pull the list from the issues reported to nlohmann/json labelled as bug and are currently open or were opened since the last release. This list is then stored using GitHub, thereby enabling a traceability of the list.
- How (and how often) do we check these lists for relevant bugs and known vulnerabilities?
  - **Answer**: Whenever we generate the documentation, the list is pulled. If there is an issue previously unrecorded, then the maintainer is encouraged by the change of the trustable score to check the relevance of the issue.
- How confident can we be that the lists are honestly maintained?
  - **Answer**: Very confident, since the authors of the issues in the list mainly comprise independent downstream users.
- Could some participants have incentives to manipulate information?
  - **Answer**: No such incentives have been identified.
- How confident are we that the lists are comprehensive?
  - **Answer**: Fairly confident, considering the wide use of the library (see JLS-05) and that downstream users are likely to report discovered bugs.
- Could there be whole categories of bugs/vulnerabilities still undiscovered?
  - **Answer**: Unlikely, considering the wide use of the library (see JLS-05) and that downstream users are likely to report discovered bugs.
- How effective is our triage/prioritisation?
  - **Answer**: There is no development of the json library within S-CORE, and therefore no triage/prioritisation. Any identified bugs/vulnerabilities are reported to nlohmann/json. Within nlohmann/json, no formal triage process has been identified. Nevertheless, reported bugs and vulnerabilities seem to be handled in a timely manner.
- How many components have never been updated?
  - **Answer**: None, the nlohmann/json library consists of a single header file, which the only component. This component is up to date.
- How confident are we that we could update them?
  - **Answer**: Within nlohmann/json, there are no external components to update. Within S-CORE, if a new version of the nlohmann/json library is released, we are very confident that we can update to that version. (See the update process in TSF/README.md)
- How confident are we that outstanding fixes do not impact our Expectations?
  - **Answer**: No outstanding fixes that impact the Expectations have been identified.
- How confident are we that outstanding fixes do not address Misbehaviours?
  - **Answer**: Very confident, as no Misbehaviours have been identified.

(Note: The guidance, evidence, confidence scoring and checklist sections below are copied from [CodeThink's documentation of TSF](https://codethinklabs.gitlab.io/trustable/trustable/trustable/TA.html). However, the answers to each point in the evidence list and checklist are specific to this project.)

Not all deviations from Expected Behaviour can be associated with a specific
condition. Therefore, we must have a strategy for managing deviations that
arise from unknown system states, process vulnerabilities or configurations.

This is the role of _Advanced Warning Indicators (AWI)_. These are specific
metrics which correlate with deviations from Expected Behaviour and can be
monitored in real time. The system should return to a defined known-good
state when AWIs exceed defined tolerances.

**Guidance**

This assertion is met to the extent that:

- We have identified indicators that are strongly correlated with observed
  deviations from Expected Behaviour in testing and/or production.
- The system returns to a defined known-good state when AWIs exceed
  defined tolerances.
- The mechanism for returning to the known-good state is verified.
- The selection of Advance Warning Indicators is validated against the set of
  possible deviations from Expected behaviour.

Note, the set of possible deviations from Expected behaviour _is not_ the same
as the set of Misbehaviours identified in TA-MISBEHAVIOURS, as it includes
deviations due to unknown causes.

Deviations are easily determined by negating recorded Expectations. Potential
AWIs could be identified using source code analysis, risk analysis or incident
reports. A set of AWIs to be used in production should be identified by
monitoring candidate signals in all tests (functional, soak, stress) and
measuring correlation with deviations.

Telematics, diagnostics, or manual proof testing are of little value without
mitigation. As such, AWI monitoring and mitigation should be automatic,
traceable back to analysis, and formally recorded to ensure information from
previously unidentified misbehaviours is captured in a structured way.

The known-good state should be chosen with regard to the system's intended
consumers and/or context. Canonical examples are mechanisms like reboots,
resets, relaunches and restarts. The mechanism for returning to a known-good
state can be verified using fault induction tests. Incidences of AWIs triggering
a return to the known-good state in either testing or production should be
considered as a Misbehaviour in TA-MISBEHAVIOURS. Relying on AWIs alone is not
an acceptable mitigation strategy. TA-MISBEHAVIOURS and TA-INDICATORS are
treated separately for this reason.

The selection of AWIs can be validated by analysing failure data. For instance,
a high number of instances of deviations with all AWIs in tolerance implies the
set of AWIs is incorrect, or the tolerance is too lax.

indicators is comprehensive / complete, that the indicators are useful, and that
monitoring mechanisms have been implemented to collect the required data.

(Note: The guidance, evidence, confidence scoring and checklist sections below are copied from [CodeThink's documentation of TSF](https://codethinklabs.gitlab.io/trustable/trustable/trustable/TA.html). However, the answers to each point in the evidence list and checklist are specific to this project.)

**Guidance**

Anything that can influence the output of the nlohmann/json project is considered an input.
This includes:

- Software components used to implement specified features and meet defined Expectations
- Software tools, and their outputs, used for design, construction and verification
- Infrastructure that supports development and release processes

All inputs (components, tools, data) and their dependencies (recursively) used to build and verify nlohmann/json releases must be identified and assessed, since they are untrusted by default.

Each input should be evaluated on verifiable merits, regardless of any claims it makes (including adherence to standards or guidance).
Evaluation must include the project's defined Expectations to ensure that inputs meet requirements, and that risks are recorded and addressed appropriately.

For components, we need to consider how their misbehaviour might impact achieving project nlohmann/json's Expectations.
Sources (e.g. bug databases, advisories) for known risks should be identified, their update frequency recorded, and tests defined for detecting them.
These form the inputs to TA-FIXES.

For the tools used to construct and verify nlohmann/json, we need to consider how their misbehaviour could:

- Introduce unintended changes
- Fail to detect Misbehaviours during testing
- Produce misleading data used to design or verify the next iteration

Where any input impacts are identified, consider:

- How serious their impact might be, and whether Expectations or analysis outcomes are affected (severity)
- Whether they are detected by another tool, test, or manual check (detectability)

Confidence in assessing severity and detectability can be supported by analysing development history and practices of each input to evaluate upstream sources (both third-party and first-party) for maintainability and sustainability (including, for example, testability, modularity and configurability) to reduce failure impact and support safe change.

These qualities can be estimated through evidence of software engineering best practice, applied through:

- Processes defining and following design, documentation and review guidelines, carried out manually (advocating simple design, reuse, structured coding constructs, and competent release management)
- Appropriate use of programming languages and their features, supported by tools such as static analysis, with regular improvement of their configurations

For impacts with high severity or low detectability (or both), additional analysis should assess whether existing tests effectively detect Misbehaviours and their impacts.

As a result, for example, any binary inputs without reproducible build steps or clear development history and maintenance processes should be treated as risks and mitigated appropriately.

(Note: The guidance, evidence, confidence scoring and checklist sections below are copied from [CodeThink's documentation of TSF](https://codethinklabs.gitlab.io/trustable/trustable/trustable/TA.html). However, the answers to each point in the evidence list and checklist are specific to this project.)

**Guidance**

This assertion is best satisfied by checking generated documentation to confirm that:

- every iteration is a working product with evidence-backed, falsifiable Statements, together with documentation of confidence in those Statements and all required Trustable Statements.
- every iteration includes instructions for building and using the product
- all components, dependencies, tools, and data are identified in a manifest
- the manifest provides links to source code
- where source code is unavailable, the supplier is identified

An iteration consists of each batch of changes accepted into the canonical version of the product.
How the canonical version is managed must be documented (for TT-CHANGES) alongside the product's Expectations.

Every iteration must be usable as a standalone product, with verification and validation completed so that a hotfix could be released at any point.
Documentation generated alongside the product must include build and usage guidance together with the project's documented Expectations and supporting Statements, enabling any maintainer or user to reverify the state of the product and associated Statements.

For each iteration, any changes must be accompanied by attestations and reasoning, explaining the tests performed and the review steps taken, together with their outcomes (e.g., results of source code inspections).
Any attestations and impact assessments must be traceable to the specific changes, authors, reviewers, and the review process documentation used.

Collating and making available all appropriate data and documentation for every iteration must be automatable, so that the product's build can be reproduced and its analysis repeated end-to-end independently (best achieved using generated documentation and configuration as code).
All relevant data, including approval statuses and dates, must be stored long-term and analysed as part of TA-DATA.
For complex systems, the resulting information must be presented in a user-friendly, searchable, and accessible form.

Given such transparent documentation and attestations for every iteration, it becomes possible to analyse product and development trends over time.
For releases, additional documentation should summarise all changes across the iterations since the previous release.

**Evidence**

- list of components with source
  - source code
    - **Answer**: Provided by JLS-10.
  - build instructions
    - **Answer**: Provided by JLS-10 and JLS-19.

  - test results summary
    - **Answer**: Provided by JLS-10.
  - attestations
    - **Answer**: Provided by JLS-52.

- list of components where source code is not available
  - risk analysis
    - **Answer**: There are no components without source code within this project.
  - attestations
    - **Answer**: There are no components without source code within this project.

**Confidence scoring**

Confidence scoring for TA-ITERATIONS based on

- number and importance of source components
- number and importance of non-source components
- assessment of attestations

**Checklist**

- How much of the software is provided as binary only, expressed as a
  fraction of the BoM list?
  - **Answer**: 0% is provided as binary only. The entire library consists of source code in the form of a single C++ header file.
- How much is binary, expressed as a fraction of the total storage footprint?
  - **Answer**: 0% is provided as binary. The entire library consists of source code in the form of a single C++ header file.
- For binaries, what claims are being made and how confident are we in the
  people/organisations making the claims?
  - **Answer**: 0% is provided as binary. The entire library consists of source code in the form of a single C++ header file.
- For third-party source code, what claims are we making, and how confident
  are we about these claims?
  - **Answer**: The nlohmann/json library has no external dependencies/accesses to third party source code, as stated in JLS-34.
- For software developed by us, what claims are we making, and how confident
  are we about these claims?
  - **Answer**: There is no software developed by us, as we just use the original nlohmann/json library within eclipse_score/inc_nlohmann_json. For the code developed in nlohmann/json, all claims and confidence are provided in the statements. See e.g., all the no-json-faults (NJF) items.

(Note: The guidance, evidence, confidence scoring and checklist sections below are copied from [CodeThink's documentation of TSF](https://codethinklabs.gitlab.io/trustable/trustable/trustable/TA.html). However, the answers to each point in the evidence list and checklist are specific to this project.)

**Guidance**

To satisfy this assertion, all manual processes used in the verification of nlohmann/json must be documented, including the methodologies applied, the results for specific aspects and iterations, and evidence that these processes were reviewed against documented criteria.

Most analysis (e.g., data analysis for TA-ANALYSIS) should be automated to enable continuous feedback.
However, the quality of any remaining manual processes (whether from first parties or external third parties) must be considered and how they are documented and reviewed.
Considerations should be made about how manual processes may impact identifying and addressing Misbehaviours (TA-MISBEHAVIOURS).

Assignment of responsibilities for any manual work must follow a documented process that verifies competence and grants appropriate access, with automation applied where possible.
Resulting assigned responsibilities must ensure organisational robustness (e.g., avoidance of conflicts of interest) together with appropriate independent verification and validation.
Manual reviews involving source inspections must follow documented guidelines, with exceptions recorded and illustrated through examples.
These guidelines should evolve over time and cover:

- coding patterns (e.g., good patterns, anti-patterns, defensive coding)
- structured design practices (e.g., control flow constraints)
- complexity management (e.g., limiting feature creep)
- documentation (e.g., clear, formal figures and diagrams)
- feature subset restrictions (e.g., programming language subsets)
- code of conduct guidelines (e.g., review etiquette, handling disagreements)

Nevertheless, specific coding rules (e.g., memory allocation, typing, concurrency) should be integrated into automatic linting and static analysis tools where appropriate.

All processes and checks must themselves be reviewed to drive continuous improvement following specified guidelines.
Any resulting changes from reviews must follow change control, regardless of who initiates them or under what circumstances.

**Evidence**

- Manual process documentation
  - **Answer**: Manual processes relevant for nlohmann/json have been identified and documented (see JLS-36, 40, 41, 42, 43 and 44).
- References to methodologies applied as part of these processes
  - **Answer**: The corresponding references are given for each statement (see JLS-36, 40, 41, 42, 43 and 44).
- Results of applying the processes
  - **Answer**: Results include reviewed and merged pull requests, maintained high test coverage, published security advisories and resolved issues, updated documentation on json.nlohmann.me (see JLS-36, 40, 41, 42, 43 and 44).
- Criteria used to confirm that the processes were applied correctly
  - **Answer**: The criteria are given in the documentation (see JLS-36, 40, 41, 42, 43 and 44).
- Review records for results
  - **Answer**: Review records are provided by GitHub pull-request reviews and comments, issue and advisory discussions, as well as release notes describing behavioural and documentation changes (see JLS-36, 40, 41, 42, 43 and 44).

**Confidence scoring**

Confidence scoring for TA-METHODOLOGIES is based on identifying areas of need for
manual processes, assessing the clarity of proposed processes, analysing the
results of their implementation, and evaluating the evidence of effectiveness
in comparison to the analysed results

**Checklist**

- Are the identified gaps documented clearly to justify using a manual process?
  - **Answer**: Manual processes are introduced where automation is not feasible and are clearly documented. While no explicit justification for each manual step is provided, the rationale is generally clear from the surrounding context.
- Are the goals for each process clearly defined?
  - **Answer**: Yes. For the manual processes that were found the goals are clearly defined in the corresponding documentation. The goals include ensuring that user-facing documentation accurately reflect behavioural and API changes, correctly handling bug and vulnerability reports, and keeping the test suite at (or close to) 100% coverage for non-trivial changes.
- Is the sequence of procedures documented in an unambiguous manner?
  - **Answer**: Largely yes. Where necessary, examples and templates make the expected sequence explicit.
- Can improvements to the processes be suggested and implemented?
  - **Answer**: Improvements are proposed via GitHub issues or pull request.
- How frequently are processes changed?
  - **Answer**: Process changes are infrequent and usually happen with a new nlohmann/json release, when a need for improvement is identified. 
- How are changes to manual processes communicated?
  - **Answer**: Mostly, changes are communicated through updated documentation in the repository and release notes.
- Are there any exceptions to the processes?
  - **Answer**: Known exceptions include automatic dependency updates from Dependabot as well as smaller trivial changes (such as fixing typos in documentation). These are exempted from having to manually create issues and explain the rationale behind the change. 
- How is evidence of process adherence recorded?
  - **Answer**: Evidence in GitHub; PR histories with reviews and passing checks, issue and advisory discussions, audit trails for documentation and test updates
- How is the effectiveness of the process evaluated?
  - **Answer**: Effectiveness is evaluated indirectly via stable releases, test coverage, and documentation quality.
- Is ongoing training required to follow these processes?
  - **Answer**: No formal training is required, but contributors are expected to be familiar with the contribution guidelines and security policy.

(Note: The guidance, evidence, confidence scoring and checklist sections below are copied from [CodeThink's documentation of TSF](https://codethinklabs.gitlab.io/trustable/trustable/trustable/TA.html). However, the answers to each point in the evidence list and checklist are specific to this project.)

The goal of TA-MISBEHAVIOURS is to force engineers to think critically about their work.
This means understanding and mitigating as many of the situations that cause the
software to deviate from Expected Behaviours as possible. This is not limited to
the contents of the final binary.

**Guidance**

This assertion is satisfied to the extent that we can:

- Show we have identified all of the ways in which nlohmann/json could deviate from its
  Expected Behaviours.
- Demonstrate that mitigations have been specified, verified and validated for
  all Misbehaviours.

Once Expected Behaviours have been identified in TA-BEHAVIOURS, there are at
least four classes of Misbehaviour that can be identified:

- Reachable vulnerable system states that cause deviations from Expected
  Behaviour. These can be identified by stress testing, failures in functional
  and soak testing in TA-BEHAVIOURS and reporting in TA-FIXES. Long run trends
  in both test and production data should also be used to identify these states.
- Potentially unreachable vulnerable system states that could lead to deviations
  from Expected Behaviour. These can be identified using risk/hazard analysis
  techniques including HAZOP, FMEDA and STPA.
- Vulnerabilities in the development process that could lead to deviations from
  Expected Behaviour. This includes those that occur as a result of misuse,
  negligence or malicious intent. These can be identified by incident
  investigation, random sampling of process artifacts and STPA of processes.
- Configurations in integrating projects (including the computer or embedded
  system that is the final product) that could lead to deviations from Expected
  Behaviour.

Identified Misbehaviours must be mitigated. Mitigations include patching,
re-designing components, re-designing architectures, removing components,
testing, static analysis etc. They explicitly _do not_ include the use of AWIs
to return to a known-good state. These are treated specifically and in detail in
TA-INDICATORS.

Mitigations could be verified by:

- Specifying and repeatedly executing false negative tests to confirm that
  functional tests detect known classes of misbehaviour.
- Specifying fault induction tests or stress tests to demonstrate that the
  system continues providing the Expected Behaviour after entering a vulnerable
  system state.
- Performing statistical analysis of test data, including using statistical path
  coverage to demonstrate that the vulnerable system state is never reached.
- Conducting fault injections in development processes to demonstrate that
  vulnerabilities cannot be exploited (knowingly or otherwise) to affect either
  output binaries or our analysis of it, whether this is by manipulating the
  source code, build environment, test cases or any other means.
- Stress testing of assumptions of use. That is, confirming assumptions of use
  are actually consistent with the system and its Expected Behaviours by
  intentionally misinterpreting or liberally interpreting them in a test
  environment. For example, we could consider testing nlohmann/json on different pieces of
  hardware that satisfy its assumptions of use.

Remember that a Misbehaviour is _anything_ that could lead to a deviation from
Expected Behaviour. The specific technologies in and applications of nlohmann/json should
always be considered in addition to the guidance above.

At the core, a faulty design is inherently difficult to mitigate. The first
priority, therefore, is to ensure a fault-tolerant and fault-avoidant design
that minimises fault impact and maximises fault control across all modes and
states. All design considerations should be traceable to analyses at the correct
abstraction level, with appropriate partitioning and scoping, which address
prevalent aspects in complex systems, such as:

- Spatial constraints (e.g., memory corruption)
- Temporal constraints (e.g., timing violations)
- Concurrency constraints (e.g., interference)
- Computational constraints (e.g., precision limits)
- Performance constraints (e.g., latency spikes under load)
- Environmental constraints (e.g., hardware non-determinism)
- Usability constraints (e.g., human interaction errors)

Finally, each new Expectation, whether a required behaviour or a misbehaviour
mitigation, introduces the potential for unexpected emergent properties,
highlighting the importance of simple, understandable designs that build on
established and reusable solutions.

(Note: The guidance, evidence, confidence scoring and checklist sections below are copied from [CodeThink's documentation of TSF](https://codethinklabs.gitlab.io/trustable/trustable/trustable/TA.html). However, the answers to each point in the evidence list and checklist are specific to this project.)

**Guidance**

This assertion is satisfied if each iteration of nlohmann/json is *repeatable*, with all
required inputs controlled, and *reproducible* (covering both nlohmann/json and the
construction toolchain/environment, as described in TA-TESTS).

This assertion can be most effectively satisfied in a Continuous Integration
environment with mirrored projects (see TA-SUPPLY_CHAIN) and build servers
without internet access. The aim is to show that all build tools, nlohmann/json
components, and dependencies are built from controlled inputs, that rebuilding
produces the same binary fileset, and that builds can be repeated on any
suitably configured server, with server differences shown not to affect
reproducibility.

For releases in particular, builds from source must be shown to produce
identical outputs both with and without cache access. 

Again this will not be achievable for components/tools provided in binary form,
or accessed via an external service - we must consider our confidence in
attestations made by/for the supply chain.

All non-reproducible elements, such as timestamps or embedded random values from
build metadata, are clearly identified and considered when evaluating
reproducibility.

As a result, we gain increased confidence that the toolchain behaves correctly
during version upgrades: unintended changes to the project are avoided, intended
fixes produce the expected effects, and the constructed output of nlohmann/json shows the
correct behavioural changes, verified and validated with test results according
to TT-RESULTS analysis.

**Evidence**

- list of reproducible SHAs
  - **Answer**: JLS-14 ensures that the SHA value of the nlohmann/json library used within eclipse-score/inc_nlohmann_json coincides with the SHA value provided by Niels Lohmann (for the same version).
- list of non-reproducible elements with:
  - explanation and justification
    - **Answer**: The only elements which are not reproducible are 8 CMake integration tests. The list of these, together with explanation and justification, is provided in TSF/docs/non_reproducible_tests.md.
  - details of what is not reproducible
    - **Answer**: The only elements which are not reproducible are 8 CMake integration tests. The list of these, together with explanation and justification, is provided in TSF/docs/non_reproducible_tests.md.
- evidence of configuration management for build instructions and infrastructure
  - **Answer**: Provided by JLS-10 and JLS-19.
- evidence of repeatable builds
  - **Answer**: Provided by JLS-53.

**Confidence scoring**

Calculate:

R = number of reproducible components (including sources which have no build stage)
N = number of non-reproducible
B = number of binaries
M = number of mirrored
X = number of things not mirrored

Confidence scoring for TA-RELEASES could possibly be calculated as
R / (R + N + B + M / (M + X))

**Checklist**

- How confident are we that all components are taken from within our
  controlled environment?
  - **Answer**: We are very confident that all components are taken from within our controlled environment, as there are currently no external components used within the nlohmann/json library (as documented in JLS-34).
- How confident are we that all of the tools we are using are also under our
  control?
  - **Answer**: All tools used by nlohmann/json are mirrored within our controlled environment eclipse-score/inc_nlohmann_json. Therefore, these tools are under full control of the Eclipse S-Core organisation.
- Are our builds repeatable on a different server, or in a different context?
  - **Answer**: Since there is no "build" of the header-only library, yes.
- How sure are we that our builds don't access the internet?
  - **Answer**: We are confident that our builds don't access the internet, since there is no "build" of the header-only library.
- How many of our components are non-reproducible?
  - **Answer**:  All of our components are reproducible, since we only use a single component, the nlohmann/json library.
- How confident are we that our reproducibility check is correct?
  - **Answer**: We are very confident that our reproducibility check is correct.

source code for nlohmann/json and all of its dependencies (including transitive
dependencies, all the way down), and for all of the tools used to construct
nlohmann/json from source, and have mirrored versions of these inputs under our control.
Any associated data and documentation dependencies must also be considered.

'Mirrored' in this context means that we have a version of the upstream project
that we keep up-to-date with additions and changes to the upstream project,
but which is protected from changes that would delete the project, or remove
parts of its history.

Clearly this is not possible for components or tools (or data) that are provided only in
binary form, or accessed via online services - in these circumstances we can
only assess confidence based on attestations made by the suppliers, and on our
experience with the suppliers' people and processes.

Keep in mind that even if repositories with source code for a particular
component or tool are available, not all of it may be stored in Git as
plaintext. A deeper analysis is required in TA-INPUTS to assess the impact of any
binaries present within the repositories of the components and tools used.

**Evidence**

- list of all nlohmann/json components including
  - URL of mirrored projects in controlled environment
    - **Answer**: Provided in JLS-23, JLS-49, and complemented by JLS-34. 
  - URL of upstream projects
    - **Answer**: Provided in JLS-23 and JLS-49.
- successful build of nlohmann/json from source
  - without access to external source projects
    - **Answer**: As a header-only library, the nlohmann/json library requires no compilation. For the build of the test suite, see JLS-49.
  - without access to cached data
    - **Answer**: The library and test suite build require no cached data. CMake configuration runs from scratch, generating all artifacts deterministically as shown in ubuntu.yml workflow clean builds.
- update logs for mirrored projects
  - **Answer**: Updates of nlohmann/json are documented in release notes (see JLS-13). The update process of eclipse-score/inc_nlohmann_json is detailed in the "Update Concept" section of TSF/README.md.
- mirrors reject history rewrites
  - **Answer**: The eclipse-score/inc_nlohmann_json main branch is set up with a branch protection rule, which disallows force pushes and requires code reviews for all changes. The branch protection rule prevents history rewrites (see JLS-66).
- mirroring is configured via infrastructure under direct control
  - **Answer**: The eclipse-score/inc_nlohmann_json repository, which contains the mirrors, is configured by "Otterdog", which is under direct control by eclipse-score maintainers (see JLS-66).

**Confidence scoring**

Confidence scoring for TA-SUPPLY_CHAIN is based on confidence that all inputs and
dependencies are identified and mirrored, and that mirrored projects cannot be
compromised.

**Checklist**

- Could there be other components, missed from the list?
  - **Answer**: Yes. The build toolchain is not mirrored (e.g., compilers like GCC and Clang, build tools like Bazel, and CMake, etc). The potential risk of these being deleted or unavailable is however negligible and accepted.
- Does the list include all toolchain components?
  - **Answer**: See answer above.
- Does the toolchain include a bootstrap?
  - **Answer**: See answer above.
- Could the content of a mirrored project be compromised by an upstream change?
  - **Answer**: No. Upstream changes are only introduced into the mirror through manually reviewed merge requests, and not automatically.
- Are mirrored projects up to date with the upstream project?
  - **Answer**: Yes. As of 4/12/2025 both the nlohmann/json mirror and nlohmann/json_test_data mirror are up to date with the upstream projects.
- Are mirrored projects based on the correct upstream?
  - **Answer**: Yes.

(Note: The guidance, evidence, confidence scoring and checklist sections below are copied from [CodeThink's documentation of TSF](https://codethinklabs.gitlab.io/trustable/trustable/trustable/TA.html). However, the answers to each point in the evidence list and checklist are specific to this project.)

**Guidance**

This assertion is satisfied if all build and test environments and tools used to support Expectations are shown to be
*reproducible*, all build and test steps are *repeatable*, and all required inputs are controlled.
TA-TESTS does not include reproducibility of nlohmann/json itself, this is instead included in TA-RELEASES.

All tools and test environments should be constructed from change-managed sources (see TA-UPDATES) and mirrored
sources (see TA-SUPPLY_CHAIN).
Additional evidence needs to demonstrate that construction of tools and environments produces the same binary fileset
used for testing and that builds can be repeated on any suitably configured server
(similar to how the nlohmann/json is evaluated for TA-RELEASES).

Test environment repeatability should be ensured to enable effective Misbehaviour investigations, and enable additional
data generations (including those by third parties).
To achieve repeatability, all infrastructure, hardware, and configurations must be identified and documented for all
test environments. Storage of this information is evaluated in TA-DATA, and its availability is considered in
TA-ITERATIONS.

**Evidence**

- Test build environment reproducibility
  - **Answer**: Provided by JLS-62.
- Test build configuration
  - **Answer**: Provided by JLS-16.
- Test build reproducibility
  - **Answer**: Provided by JLS-62.
- Test environment configuration
  - **Answer**: Provided by JLS-16.

**Confidence scoring**

Confidence scoring for TA-TESTS is based on confidence that the construction and deployment of test environments,
tooling and their build environments are repeatable and reproducible.

**CHECKLIST**

- How confident are we that our test tooling and environment setups used for tests, fault inductions, and analyses are reproducible?
  - **Answer**:  The test can be reproduced any time on any machine running the versions of the operating systems and compilers as provided, as described in AOU-14.
  - Are any exceptions identified, documented and justified?
    - **Answer**: To the best of our knowledge, there are no exceptions identified.
- How confident are we that all test components are taken from within our controlled environment?
  - **Answer**: All tests are either self-contained or download test data from [within Eclipse S-CORE](https://github.com/eclipse-score/inc_nlohmann_json/tree/json_test_data_version_3_1_0_mirror).
- How confident are we that all of the test environments we are using are also under our control?
  - **Answer**: Very confident, as the environments are standard docker images of ubuntu and standard versions of compilers that are executed in our CI pipeline.
- Do we record all test environment components, including hardware and infrastructure used for exercising tests and processing input/output data?
  - **Answer**: No, since the tests are independent from hardware, there is no record of hardware or infrastructure.
- How confident are we that all tests scenarios are repeatable?
  - **Answer**: All test scenarios are repeated daily in the CI pipeline.

(Note: The guidance, evidence, confidence scoring and checklist sections below are copied from [CodeThink's documentation of TSF](https://codethinklabs.gitlab.io/trustable/trustable/trustable/TA.html). However, the answers to each point in the evidence list and checklist are specific to this project.)

**Guidance**

This assertion requires control over all changes to nlohmann/json, including configurations, components, tools, data, documentation, and dependency versions used to build, verify, and validate it.

As part of change control, all automated checks must run and pass (e.g., tests, static analysis, lint checks) before accepting proposed changes.
These checks must be configured against appropriate claims and coding guidelines.
Where a change affects tracked claims, the impact must be identified, reasoned, and verified, with linked analysis performed (e.g., input analysis for new dependencies as per TA-INPUTS).
Even changes with no direct impact on project claims must be justified.

Multiple roles (assigned to appropriate parties under suitable guidelines) should be involved in assessing changes.
Reviews must focus on the integrity and consistency of claims, the software, and its tests.
What each reviewer did or did not examine must be recorded, and this information (together with all checks) made available for every change throughout the project lifecycle (see TA-DATA).
Details of manual quality management aspects are addressed in TA-METHODOLOGIES.

As a result, all changes must be regression-free (blocking problematic changes until resolved) and aim to exhibit the following properties:

- simple
- atomic
- modular
- understandable
- testable
- maintainable
- sustainable

Practices that enforce these properties help identify and resolve inconsistent changes early in development.

Change control itself must not be subverted, whether accidentally or maliciously.
Process documentation, guidance, and automated checks must also be under change control, approved by appropriate parties, and protected with suitable security controls.

To prevent regressions and reduce the rate of bugs and vulnerabilities, consistent dependency updates must be applied and new issues promptly addressed (TA-FIXES).
Evidence for each iteration must demonstrate that change control requirements are applied consistently and evolve as improvements are identified, ensuring the process remains repeatable and reproducible.
Timeliness must be monitored across detection, resolution, and deployment, with automation and process improvements introduced where delays are found.

Ultimately, the trustable controlled process is the only path to production for the constructed target software.

**Evidence**

- change management process and configuration artifacts
  - **Answer**: Provided in JLS-06, JLS-07, JLS-12, JLS-32, JLS-34, JLS-35 and AOU-27. 

**Confidence scoring**

Confidence scoring for TA-UPDATES is based on confidence that we have
control over the changes that we make to nlohmann/json, including its configuration and
dependencies.

**Checklist**

- Where are the change and configuration management controls specified?
  - **Answer**: In the [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/nlohmann/json?tab=contributing-ov-file#readme) and [security policy](https://github.com/nlohmann/json?tab=security-ov-file#readme). 
- Are these controls enforced for all of components, tools, data, documentation and configurations?
  - **Answer**: Yes. Any proposed change is subject to the same change controls.
- Are there any ways in which these controls can be subverted, and have we mitigated them?
  - **Answer**: No. The controls are enforced using branch protection rules and are mostly automated.
- Does change control capture all potential regressions?
  - **Answer**: Yes. All changes are tested in the branch '[develop](https://github.com/nlohmann/json/actions?query=branch%3Adevelop)' before being deployed to the master branch.
- Is change control timely enough?
  - **Answer**: The change control is indeed timely enough. Any [issues](https://github.com/nlohmann/json/issues) or [discussions](https://github.com/nlohmann/json/discussions) opened are addressed within a reasonable time frame.
- Are all guidance and checks understandable and consistently followed?
  - **Answer**: Yes. The [contribution guideline](https://github.com/nlohmann/json?tab=contributing-ov-file#readme) is clear and well-documented, and checks are enforced through automatic [CI workflows](https://github.com/nlohmann/json/tree/develop/.github/workflows).

(Note: The guidance, evidence, confidence scoring and checklist sections below are copied from [CodeThink's documentation of TSF](https://codethinklabs.gitlab.io/trustable/trustable/trustable/TA.html). However, the answers to each point in the evidence list and checklist are specific to this project.)

**Guidance**

This assertion is satisfied when tests demonstrate that the features specified to meet project Expectations (TT-EXPECTATIONS) are present and function as intended.
These tests run repeatedly in a controlled environment (TA-TESTs) on a defined schedule (e.g., daily, per change, or per candidate release of nlohmann/json).

Confidence grows when tests not only verify Expectations but also validate (continuously) that they meet stakeholder and user needs.
Robust validation depends on three aspects:

- TA-VALIDATION – a strategy that produces representative and stressing data.
- TA-DATA – appropriate handling of collected data.
- TA-ANALYSIS – analysis methods that remain dependable as the project evolves.

This structure enables iterative convergence toward required behaviours, even when early validation results are unsatisfactory.

A strategy to generate appropriate data addresses quantity, quality, and selection:

- Selection: Testing remains exploratory, combining monitoring with verified and new indicators (supporting TA-INDICATORS). 
  Coverage spans input, design, and output analysis with traceable specifications and results (considering TA-BEHAVIOURS).
  Tests also support calibration of capacity, scalability, response time, latency, and throughput, executed in targetted conditions and under stress (e.g., equivalence class and boundary-value testing).
- Quantity: Automation scheduling provides sufficient repetition and covers diverse environments (e.g., multiple hardware platforms).
  Failures block merge requests, with pre- and post-merge tests giving fast feedback.
  Adequacy of data is assessed through TA-ANALYSIS.
- Quality: Test suites include fault induction (considering TA-MISBEHAVIOURS) and checks that good data yields good results while bad data yields bad results.

**Evidence**

- Test results from per-change tests
  - **Answer**: CI runs the tests on each change (JLS-01), and their results are stored in the persistent test results database (JLS-18, JLS-45).
- Test results from scheduled tests as time series
  - **Answer**: Provided in JLS-22.

**Confidence scoring**

Confidence scoring for TA-VALIDATION is based on verification that we have
results for all expected tests (both pass / fail and performance).

**Checklist**

- Is the selection of tests correct?
  - **Answer**: The upstream nlohmann/json test suite plus the additional TSF-related tests cover the expected behaviours captured in the Expectations (JLEX-01, JLEX-02).
- Are the tests executed enough times?
  - **Answer**: Yes, tests run on each pull request and push via the CI workflows (JLS-01) and additionally on a daily schedule in inc_nlohmann_json (JLS-22).
- How confident are we that all test results are being captured?
  - **Answer**: For the CI workflows that write to the persistent test-results database we are reasonably confident, since capture is automated by the TSF scripts (JLS-18, JLS-45).
- Can we look at any individual test result, and establish what it relates to?
  - **Answer**: For CI runs, yes. Each stored test result is linked to a specific CI workflow run (repo, run_id, run_attempt) and timestamp in workflow_info, so we can relate it back to the corresponding GitHub workflow execution, code revision and CI configuration (see JLS-18).
- Can we trace from any test result to the expectation it relates to?
  - **Answer**: Each stored test result includes the test name (e.g. `test-unicode1`), which maps to a concrete test source file. These test files are referenced in TSF statements (e.g. `NPF-01.1`) that are linked to their parent Expectations (e.g. `NPF-01`). This allows us to trace from an individual test result to the corresponding Expectation.
- Can we identify precisely which environment (software and hardware) were used?
  - **Answer**: For CI runs we can identify the software environment (OS image, compiler, and configuration) via the stored metadata and `list_of_test_environments.md` (JLS-17, JLS-18). The exact GitHub-hosted hardware is only roughly known and is not considered critical for this library.
- How many pass/fail results would be expected, based on the scheduled tests?
  - **Answer**: All scheduled unit and integration tests are expected to pass (zero failures).
- Do we have all of the expected results?
  - **Answer**: Yes, for the selected workflows we typically have results for each run, potential gaps arise when CI runs are skipped or cancelled, or due to storge limitation. 
- Do we have time-series data for all of those results?
  - **Answer**: Stored test results are timestamped and can be queried as a time series (JLS-18, JLS-45), but due to storage limits we only keep a truncated history rather than a complete time series over the whole project lifetime.
- If there are any gaps, do we understand why?
  - **Answer**: Yes, gaps arise by design from the memory sensitive storage strategy (only initial snapshots and relevant changes are kept, see TSF/scripts/README.md and JLS-45), from the fixed size limits on the persistent database, and from the fact that we do not collect runtime monitoring data for deployed instances yet (see AOU-09, AOU-18 and AOU-19).
- Are the test validation strategies credible and appropriate?
  - **Answer**: Yes, the upstream nlohmann/json test suite is extensive and is complemented by additional TSF-related tests. These tests are executed on each change and on a daily schedule via CI (JLS-01, JLS-22), and their results are stored and analysed through TA-DATA and TA-ANALYSIS.
- What proportion of the implemented tests are validated?
  - **Answer**: For the CI workflows, all implemented automated unit and integration tests are executed and their results are captured in the persistent database.
- Have the tests been verified using known good and bad data?
  - **Answer**: Yes, the upstream test suite of nlohmann/json uses dedicated JSON test data (including JSON parsing test suite: https://github.com/nlohmann/json_test_data/tree/master/json_tests and the big list of naughty strings in `json_test_data`: https://github.com/nlohmann/json_test_data/tree/master/big-list-of-naughty-strings) and the parsers are fuzz-tested 24/7 via Google OSS-Fuzz, exercising many known-good and intentionally malformed inputs.
