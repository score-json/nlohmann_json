## List of all unit-tests with test environments

    This list contains all unit-tests possibly running in this project.
    These tests are compiled from the source-code, where the individual unit-tests are arranged in TEST_CASEs containing possibly nested SECTIONs.
    To reflect the structure of the nested sections, nested lists are utilised, where the top-level list represents the list of TEST_CASEs. 

    It should be noted that not all unit-tests in a test-file are executed with every compiler-configuration.

# Failure rate analysis for nlohmann/json Ubuntu CI

## Scope and data source

- **Repository:** `nlohmann/json`
- **Workflow:** `.github/workflows/ubuntu.yml`
- **Date range:** 2025-01-11 – 2025-04-11  (3 months before the release date of the version v3.12.0)
- **Filter:** `workflow_file_name: ubuntu.yml`

GitHub’s “failure rate” counts all non-successful job runs, including cancelled
jobs (e.g. quickly closed PRs) and infrastructure/tooling problems, not only
true regressions in the JSON library.

## Jobs with the highest reported failure rates

From the Jobs table (sorted by Failure rate):

| Job (short name)                           | Failure rate | Avg. run time | Job runs |

## Interpretation of the higher failure rates

### `ci_test_coverage_clang`

This job was a short-lived Clang coverage experiment. In the selected time window it only ran 6 times, several of them as part of the "Fix coverage job" pull request where the coverage script was intentionally broken and iteratively fixed. The failures in these runs are due to coverage tooling / CI configuration issues, not failing unit tests or misbehaviour in the JSON library.

### `ci_static_analysis_clang (ci_clang_tidy)`

In the analyzed period, most failed `ci_static_analysis_clang (ci_clang_tidy)` runs come from a few PRs that deliberately changed static analysis or CI tooling, plus real bug fix. In particular, PR [#4654](https://github.com/nlohmann/json/pull/4654) "Fix ~basic_json causing std::terminate", PR [#4663](https://github.com/nlohmann/json/pull/4663) "Add clang-tidy plugin to convert implicit conversions to explicit ones", and the change referenced as [#4701](https://github.com/nlohmann/json/pull/4701) "Suppress clang-analyzer-webkit.NoUncountedMemberChecker" all show multiple failed Ubuntu workflow runs while their clang-tidy / analyzer configuration was being tuned. Because this job treats every clang-tidy or analyzer diagnostic as a hard error, each new or stricter check initially makes the job fail until the warnings are fixed or suppressed. The resulting ~14 % failure rate is therefore explained by intentional tightening and maintenance of the static-analysis pipeline (plus normal PR iteration), rather than by unexplained or unaddressed misbehaviour in the library itself.

### `ci_test_coverage` 

The failure rate of `ci_test_coverage` in this period is explained by intentional CI maintenance rather than unstable tests. A significant portion of failures comes from work on PR [#4595](https://github.com/nlohmann/json/pull/4595), where the coverage workflow itself was updated and repeatedly executed on the `fix-coverage` branch and several intermediate runs failed until the configuration of `gcov`, `lcov`, and the Coveralls uploader was corrected. Additional failures stem from PR [#4709](https://github.com/nlohmann/json/pull/4709), which upgraded the minimum CMake version and introduced new CMake and OpenSSL configurations in CI. During this transition, some `ubuntu.yml` workflow runs, including the coverage job, failed until the revised toolchain setup was stabilized. All changes were merged only after `ci_test_coverage` succeeded, and the underlying unit tests remained consistently green throughout, meaning the elevated failure rate reflects CI/tooling evolution rather than regressions in the JSON library.


### `ci_test_clang`

Historically, `ci_test_clang` existed as its own standalone job in the Ubuntu workflow. With PR [#4560](https://github.com/nlohmann/json/pull/4560) (“Clean up and document project files”), the Ubuntu workflow was reorganized and `ci_test_clang` was moved into the matrix of the `ci_static_analysis_clang` job (i.e. `matrix.target: [ci_test_clang, ci_clang_tidy, …]` in `.github/workflows/ubuntu.yml`). GitHub Actions always uses the workflow file from the commit on which a PR is based, so PRs that branch off **before** [#4560](https://github.com/nlohmann/json/pull/4560) and are never rebased still run the *old* workflow, while newer PRs run the *new* workflow where `ci_test_clang` only appears as a matrix target of `ci_static_analysis_clang`. This is why `ci_test_clang` shows up in different ways in the metrics, even though it ultimately refers to the same underlying CMake target.

In this period, `ci_test_clang` ran 25 times and failed 3 times (12%). All failures occurred on PR branches while Clang related code or CI configuration was being adjusted and were resolved before the respective changes were merged. In addition, because `ci_test_clang` was later removed as a standalone Ubuntu job and replaced, the statistics for this job are based on a relatively small number of historical runs. A few legitimate work-in-progress failures therefore translate into a comparatively high percentage, without indicating persistent instability of the Clang test setup.


## Conclusion

For the selected three-month window before the v3.12.0 release, the Ubuntu CI for `nlohmann/json` shows a small set of jobs with noticeably higher failure rates, but in all cases these can be traced back to intentional CI/tooling work or strict analysis settings, not to undetected misbehaviour of the library itself. All of these high failure rates occurred on PR branches, were visible to developers, and were resolved before merging, while the majority of other jobs (including `ci_test_gcc`, `ci_test_standards_*` and most compiler-matrix entries) remain at or near 0 %. Taken together, this indicates a stable CI system that reacts as intended to real issues and configuration changes, with no evidence of systematic, unexplained spikes in test failures for the Ubuntu workflow.


# Failure rate analysis for eclipse-score/inc_nlohmann_json Parent-Workflow/Ubuntu CI

## Scope and data source

- **Repository:** `eclipse-score/inc_nlohmann_json`
- **Workflow:** `Parent Workflow` (top-level CI workflow)
- **Date range:** last 90 days from 08.12.2025
- **Filter:** `workflow_file_name: parent-workflow.yml`


GitHub’s “failure rate” counts all non-successful job runs, including cancelled
jobs (e.g. quickly closed PRs) and infrastructure/tooling problems, not only
true regressions in the JSON library.

## Jobs with the highest reported failure rates

From the Jobs table (sorted by Failure rate):

| Job (short name)                                      | Failure rate | Avg. run time | Job runs |
|:------------------------------------------------------|-------------:|--------------:|---------:|
| `Run Ubuntu Workflow / publish_test_data_success`     | **5%**       | ≈ 25 s        |      38  |
| `Run Labeler Workflow / clone_missing_labels`         | **3%**       | ≈ 6 s         |      38  |

All other Parent-Workflow jobs in the last 90 days report a failure rate of
**0 %** over 38 runs each. The remaining data can be found on the GitHub [insights page](https://github.com/eclipse-score/inc_nlohmann_json/actions/metrics/performance?dateRangeType=DATE_RANGE_TYPE_LAST_90_DAYS&sort=failureRate&tab=jobs&filters=workflow_file_name%3Aparent-workflow.yml).

## Interpretation of the higher failure rates

The job `publish_test_data_success` is the final step of the Ubuntu child
workflow that publishes the persistent test-result database
(`TSF/MemoryEfficientTestResultData.db`) back to the `save_historical_data`
branch. The observed 5.26 % failure rate corresponds to 2 failed runs out of
38, and these failures are limited to this publishing step (e.g. git push /
branch / permission issues) rather than to the execution of the tests
themselves.

The job `clone_missing_labels` belongs to the separate “Labeler Workflow” and
synchronizes GitHub issue/PR labels for this repository with the organisation
defaults. Its 2.63 % failure rate corresponds to 1 failed run out of 38,
and is related to repository/label management rather than to building or
testing the JSON library.

## Conclusion

Taken together, a period of there months show that all test-related
jobs in the Parent Workflow have 0 % failures, while the few non-zero
failure rates are confined to meta-jobs that handle publishing of historical
test data and label synchronization. This indicates a stable CI setup for
`inc_nlohmann_json`, with the only reported failures occurring in
infrastructure-side integration steps rather than in the core test pipeline.

# TSF Structure

The TSF-related additions, such as the Trustable Graph and tooling extensions, are primarily organized within the TSF folder:
- the items of the Trustable Graph are in `TSF/trustable` 
- the building blocks of the documentation, which is built with the S-CORE docs-as-code tool, is placed in `TSF/docs` 
- the report generated by [trudag](https://codethinklabs.gitlab.io/trustable/trustable/trudag/usage.html) is placed in `TSF/docs/generated`. This can either be produced as part of the CI pipeline or manually using the shell script `./TSF/scripts/generate_documentation.sh`. It is strongly recommended that the TSF/docs folder is included in the .gitignore file
- the utility scripts are documented in the `TSF/scripts` folder

The TSF graph (including links, nodes and their hashes) is saved in the `.dotstop.dot` file and the trudag extensions including CPP test references are stored in the `.dotstop_extensions` folder since these locations are required by the trudag tool.

# Release management 

The releases process of this repository shall conform to the [release management plan of Eclipse S-CORE](https://github.com/eclipse-score/score/blob/668bae4d1a704565983d34b8447d5a035696299a/docs/platform_management_plan/release_management.rst#id11). Most notably, the release tags shall follow semantic versioning format.

- The components of the tag shall be incremented both in case of an update to TSF documentation, and in case of updating to a new release of the upstream nlohmann/json library.
- Updates to TSF documentation shall increment the PATCH or MINOR component.
- Updating the version of nlohmann/json to a new release shall increment the appropriate tag component based on the extensiveness and nature of the upstream changes.
- To indicate the version of nlohmann/json in use, the nlohmann/json release tag shall always be clearly included in the release notes of this repository.
- The release notes of this repository shall always indicate whether the release includes changes to only TSF documentation, only the version of nlohmann/json, or both.

To update either the version of nlohmann/json within S-CORE or TSF documentation, please refer to the respective Update Concepts below.

# Update Concept for the version of nlohmann/json within S-CORE

## Assumptions of use

This description of the update process is based on the following structure of the repository.
It is assumed that the repository has a default branch called ``main`` containing the most recent documented version of ``nlohmann/json`` together with its documentation.
The releases of the documented nlohmann/json version are identified by release notes on ``main``.

Note that there is **no automatic information** on the existence of a new release in the original ``nlohmann/json``; instead the possibility to update is detected **manually**.
Note further that, due to the currently relatively limited use of nlohmann/json within S-CORE, there appears currently no inherent need to keep the version up to date.

## Update process of the original nlohmann/json

The releases of ``nlohmann/json`` are collected on the [Release site](https://github.com/nlohmann/json/releases) of the repository ``nlohmann/json``.
Each release announcement is expected to contain the release date, SHA-256 values for json.hpp, include.zip and json.tar.xz, and a brief list containing bug fixes, improvements, further changes and deprecated functions.
The new release is expected to be located within the branch **master** in nlohmann/json, from where the most recent version can be drawn.

## Update process of the S-CORE version

In the following, we shall describe the intricacies of updating the version of ``nlohmann/json`` within Eclipse S-CORE.
This version is not a mere fork of the original master branch of ``nlohmann/json``, but instead enriched with the documentation following the Trustable Software Framework (TSF).

The enrichment with the documentation necessitates some changes to the fork of the original repository.
For the most part, these changes are in-obtrusive, and mere additions.
In particular, the folders ``include`` and ``single-include`` remain unchanged, and should be updated without further adaptations.
In some cases, however, additional tests are run and data are generated and collected, which were not run or generated in the original ``nlohmann/json``, so that obtrusive changes of files were necessary.
For these files, and in particular the workflow files, caution must be exercised, as to not disturb the documentation.
Moreover, some parts of the documentation must be adapted to the new version.


### What can not be updated without further precautions?

* ``cmake/ci.cmake``
    This file defines, in particular, the various custom cmake targets; in particular, the various configurations for the execution of the unit- and integration-tests are defined.
    The TSF requires, or, at the very least, strongly encourages us to collect test-results.
    In order to do this efficiently, the ctest command is adapted to automatically generate the junit-logs of each test-run.
    For this, the option ``--output-junit`` is set with output path ``../my_logs/TARGETNAME_junit.xml``, where TARGETNAME is replaced by the name of the respective cmake target; in case that this convention is insufficient to uniquely identify the logs, TARGETNAME is amended by a number.
    When updating, it must be ensured that these adaptations are preserved.
    Moreover, if the update introduces new cmake targets or new executions of ctest, it must be ensured, that the junit-log is generated and stored with a similar naming convention in the folder "../my_logs/".
    Otherwise, it can not be ensured that the test data are accurately captured.

* ``cmake/download_test_data.cmake``
    This file is modified to ensure that the test-data are not downloaded from the original test-data repository, but instead from the copy of that repository within the Eclipse S-CORE organisation.
    It must be ensured that this change is preserved.

* ``tests/CMakeLists.txt``
    This file collects, in particular, the files containing the unit- and integration-tests in a list, which is given to cmake. 
    Custom tests were added in TSF/tests to document the fulfillment of the expectations. 
    To ensure that these tests are run, the file tests/CMakeLists.txt has been modified.
    During the update, it must be ensured, that the custom tests are still being executed.

* ``.github/workflows/parent-workflow.yml``
    To ensure a specific execution order for the individual github workflows, their execution is orchestrated by the parent-workflow.
    To guarantee that this order is respected, it must be ensured that every workflow except for ``comment_check_amalgamation.yml``, ``docs-cleanup.yml``, ``parent-workflow.yml``, ``scorecards.yml`` and ``stale.yml`` runs ``on workflow_call``, only.

* ``.github/workflows/ubuntu.yml``
    The ubuntu workflow orchestrates the parallel execution of various cmake targets with varying configurations running on the latest version of ubuntu.
    The first TSF related adaptation of this workflow is that every step, in which a junit-report is generated, generates an artifact.
    It must be ensured, that these artifacts are still generated after the update.
    The second adaptation is that the test-results are captured, processed and persistently stored or stored in the ubuntu-artifact.
    Therefore, it must be ensured that the jobs ``publish_test_data_success``, ``publish_test_data_failure``, ``publish_test_data_cancellation`` and ``ubuntu_artifact`` are executed.
    Moreover, in case that any further job is added by nlohmann, it must be ensured that this job is added to the list of jobs required before the latter workflows are executed.
    If any further job added by nlohmann generates a junit-log, it must be ensured that this job generates an artifact containing its junit-logs. 

* ``.github/workflows/cifuzz.yml``
    This workflow uses Google's oss-fuzz, which is not available to the copy within Eclipse S-CORE. 
    Therefore, this workflow needs to be disabled in the copy. 
    Currently, this is done by removing it altogether, which we recommend to do so that no confusion as to why this workflow is not executed arises. 

* ``.github/workflows/publish_documentation.yml``
    The original version of this workflow is replaced with a completely customised version, which reflects the use of trudag and the integration into the Eclipse S-CORE organisation.
    Therefore, it is recommended to not change this workflow. 
    In particular, the version of publish_documentation.yml in the original repository nlohmann/json must not replace the publish_documentation.yml of the present repository.

* ``.github/workflows/test_trudag_extensions.yml``
    This workflow is not present in the original nlohmann/json and must not be removed, or modified (besides updating the versions of tools, if necessary) by the update.

* Other entries of ``.github/workflows``
    For every workflow, it must be ensured that the conditions of their execution are unchanged.
    The workflows ``check_amalgamation``, ``codeql``, ``dependency_review``, ``labeler`` and ``test_trudag_extensions`` generate an artifact, which must not be changed.
    New workflows should be carefully reviewed.
    If it is determined that their execution within the project is beneficial, and that they do not interfere with, then they should be integrated within the parent workflow at an appropriate place and their execution condition should be set to on ``workflow``, or their execution should be scheduled appropriately. 
    It is strongly recommended that the new workflow produces an artifact on success, and that the validator ``check_artifact_exists`` is adapted accordingly.
    If nlohmann deletes any of the currently executed workflows, in particular ``check_amalgamation.yml``, ``codeql.yml``, ``dependency_review.yml``, ``labeler.yml``, ``test_trudag_extensions.yml`` and ``ubuntu.yml``, then it is strongly recommended to keep the currently executed version, since the automatic validator ``check_artifact_exists`` depends on the existence of these workflows.
    In case that it is determined that these workflows should be deleted also in the documented copy of ``nlohmann/json``, then the validator ``check_artifact_exists`` and all its occurrences must be adapted accordingly.

* ``ChangeLog.md``
    It must be ensured that the changes of the new release of nlohmann/json are properly described in the file ``ChangeLog.md``.


### Necessary adaptations

The following adaptation is recommended, and has, unfortunately, not been automated.

* ``TSF/trustable/statements/JLS-02.md``
    It must be carefully ensured that this statement and its references are still valid. In particular, it is strongly recommended to refer to a fuzz testing result running on the version that is updated to.


The following adaptations to the documentation have been automated; the python-script TSF/scripts/update_helper.py may be used to assist with these changes. 
For the error-free execution is it necessary, however, to adhere to the naming scheme json_version_X_XX_X, and to not change the structure of the directories.

* ``TSF/Trustable/statements/JLS-11.md``
    It must be ensured that the correct release date is used.

* ``TSF/trustable/statements/JLS-14.md``
    It must be ensured that the release of the correct version is referenced.
    Furthermore, the sha-value of the evidence must be adapted to the one provided in that announcement post.

* ``TSF/trustable/docs/introduction/index.rst``
    In this file, the version of ``nlohmann/json`` that is documented is explicitly mentioned at two places. 
    This version must be updated.
    
* ``TSF/scripts/generate_list_of_misbehaviours.py``
    This script contains version and release date hard-coded. Both must be updated.


### Recommended procedure

Based on the above observations, the following steps are recommended for each update to the library.

1. Merge branch master from the original nlohmann/json into an external fork of the eclipse-score/inc_nlohmann_json repository, where steps 2-12 shall be performed.
2. Confirm the deletion of cifuzz.yml, macos.yml and windows.yml.
3. Resolve the potential merge conflict in publish-documentation.yml by rejecting the incoming changes.
4. Update the versions of the github actions, if necessary. 
5. Resolve the potential merge conflicts in check_amalgamation.yml, codeql.yml, dependency_review.yml, labeler.yml and test_trudag_extensions.yml to ensure that the artifacts are generated, i.e. the jobs ``Generate XXX artifact`` and ``Upload XXX artifact`` are retained.
6. Resolve the potential merge conflict in ubuntu.yml following the above instructions.
7. Resolve the potential merge conflicts in cmake/download_test_data.cmake and cmake/ci.cmake following the above instructions.
8. Carefully examine the automatically merged changes. If no interference is to be expected, complete the merge.
9. In case any additional workflow has been added, carefully examine and integrate into the parent-workflow or schedule appropriately.
10. Adapt the documentation as described above.
11. Generate the TSF report locally and carefully investigate any change in the trustable score(s). 
    If any relevant behaviour of the library changes, adapt the documentation. 
    Additionally, if any additional tests were added, or existing tests were changed, carefully investigate whether these warrant an amendment of the documentation.
12. Merge into the ``main`` branch of eclipse-score/inc_nlohmann_json.
13. Create a new release tag in eclipse-score/inc_nlohmann_json, following semantic versioning.

# Update concept for the TSF documentation

## Assumptions of use

The documentation follows the Trustable Software Framework (TSF), which is documented [here](https://codethinklabs.gitlab.io/trustable/trustable/print_page.html).
Furthermore, the automatic generation of the TSF report and the tracking of changes to the core functionalities of the library uses _trudag_, which is developed by Codethink and located [here](https://gitlab.com/CodethinkLabs/trustable/trustable).


## Version of trudag

The documentation is currently built using trudag version v2025.10.22
In case of new releases of trudag in the future, it is recommended to carefully review the introduced changes and rigorously test it before merging it into eclipse-score/inc_nlohmann_json.
The following should be considered:

* How has the algorithm for the accumulation of the trustable score changed? Ideally, it is not changed, otherwise the necessity for a new review arises.
* How has the data store interface changed? Ideally, it is not changed, but if it does and the expected schema format changes, data_store.py needs to be updated accordingly.
* How has the the expected configuration for the TSF items changed? It is known that this configuration changed (at least) once before. What does the potential change mean?
* Do all custom references and validators as well as the data store interface work as before?
* Has the algorithm for the hashing changed, or are there any changes to the trustable scores? If so, investigate carefully!


## Subject-Matter-Expert-scores

The intention with the SME scores is to find the _true_ trustable score by means of a heuristic law-of-large-numbers argument. 
Therefore, it is very much welcome for contributors to add their SME scores to statements for which they feel confident to do so.
While the committer may check SME scores for plausibility, it is recommended to not question SME scores as this interferes with the assumed independence of the SME!
It is highly recommended to not delete SME scores under usual circumstances; most certainly, the SME scores should never be changed by anybody except the original SME.
The following unusual circumstances can, after careful consideration, justify the removal or (much preferably!) the request for re-evaluation by the original SMEs:

* change of references: 
    If, e.g. due to an update of ``nlohmann/json``, the references of any items (be it tests or code) changes, then this should trigger a re-evaluation of the statement. 
    In particular if the behaviour changed significantly, it can be justifiable to assume that the old SME scores do not reflect the statement anymore.
* addition of automatic validators: 
    Recall that the SME-scores have different meanings depending on whether or not an automatic validator is implemented. 
    In the absence of a validator, the SME shall assess their confidence in the statement based on linked artifacts (references) and their own knowledge. 
    In the presence of a validator, the SME shall assess only their confidence in the validator as an accurate measure of the truth of the statement.

Some important remarks regarding the process of performing an SME review include:

* Assumptions-of-Use (AoU) items are not to be scored by an SME. These should at some point in time be converted to a regular statement by the integrator, but shall until then remain without SME scores, evidence or references. These automatically contribute with a score of 0 for the time being.
* Any statement that has supporting statements (child nodes) shall not be scored by an SME. The scores for these shall only comprise of the automatic calculation of the mean of the scores of all linked child nodes.
* The TSF report is only published for the default branch of a repository. In order to to see TSF documentation for a non-default branch, the reviewer can checkout the branch in a clone and locally generate the report by running the ``TSF/scripts/generate_documentation.sh`` script.
* Any TSF item that has the ``normative`` parameter set to false shall not be scored by the SME. These are just informational and do not make a statement about the project. Note that the parameter itself shall not be set or changed by the SME, but is defined by the contributor who created the TSF item.

For documentation on how to actually perform a SME review, please refer to the following:
* https://codethinklabs.gitlab.io/trustable/trustable/trudag/usage.html#reviewing-items 
* https://codethinklabs.gitlab.io/trustable/trustable/trudag/usage.html#sme-review

## Validators

The automatic validators are intended to calculate a trustable score based on quantifiable data. 
In particular the introduction of a validator changes the meaning of the (potential) SME scores associated to a statement.
Therefore, the change or introduction of an automatic validator is most critical.
In case the validator used in a statement has been changed, it is highly recommended to urge the original SME to re-review the statement and adapt their scores, or (at the very least) to enlist additional SMEs to judge the changed statement.
After careful consideration the highly critical decision to remove some SME scores no longer reflecting the statement could be made. 

## References

References should be treated in the same way as validators, i.e. any update of a reference should trigger a re-review by the SME.
For references, however, the decision to remove a stale SME score is even more critical unless the reference reveals critical new information, which is highly unlikely, or the change of the reference is triggered by a significant change in the behaviour of the library, which heavily affected the statement.

# Scripts used for the documentation

The following scripts are used in the automatic compilation of the trustable report.

## capture_test_data.py

The python-script [capture_test_data.py](capture_test_data.py) is intended to run at the end of the [ubuntu-workflow](../../.github/workflows/ubuntu.yml). It collects and combines the test-results that were collected in the individual jobs, appends the persistent test data storage and generates a database containing the results of the most recent tests only. Since storage space on the github is limited, the storage of test data is limited to two weeks only. It must be noted that this implementation is only intended as a temporary proof of concept!

## capture_test_data_memory_sensitive.py

The python script [capture_test_data_memory_sensitive.py](capture_test_data_memory_sensitive.py) is an alternative to [capture_test_data.py](capture_test_data.py), which is more memory sensitive. 
Instead of capturing the full test-data, a first snapshot of the data is captured, which is then updated whenever a relevant change is detected.

The characterisation of "relevant change" follows the following heuristic argumentation: 

* The execution time of each test is of lesser interest, therefore it is not continuously updated.
* A test is uniquely identified by the columns ctest_target, name and cpp_standard.

Moreover, a size-check is performed on the persistent storage, using the following heuristic assumptions 

* It is expected, that an update of a test-result only happens, when a test fails, which leads automatically to the failure of the pipeline, which should trigger a manual review by the maintainer, or failed before.
* It is expected, that tests fail rarely, and in particular on average less than 10 different test-cases per workflow-run fail.
* It is expected, that less than 1,000 workflow runs, where a record of the test-result is triggered, happen per year, since these are only triggered once daily and on each push to main.
* It is expected, that a ten-year-record of test-results is sufficient for documentation purposes.

In view of these assumptions, we limit the storage to approximately 100,000 test-results and 100,000 workflow-metadata, which guarantees *en passant* that github's file size limit of 100MB is respected.
In the worst case that every recorded test result is detected as a relevant change, this restraint collects test-results from 27 workflows in total.
Whenever either limit of 100,000 test-results and 100,000 workflow-metadata in the persistent data storage is violated, the script returns the error "The persistent data storage is too large! Please move persistent data to external storage.", thereby failing the workflow, which advises the maintainer to take up action.

## clean_trudag_report.py

The python-script [clean_trudag_report.py](clean_trudag_report.py) runs at the end of generate_report.sh.
By default, the report generated by trudag has the format that is expected by MkDocs.
This format, however, is not properly rendered by sphinx, so that an adaption of the output is necessary.
This adaption happens within this script.

## generate_report.sh

The shell-script [generate_report.sh](generate_report.sh) is used to generate the trustable report and the graphs of which the documentation consists.
In particular, it first cleans up potentially left-over obsolete reports, then generates the report and the full view of the trustable graph using trudag.
Thereafter, plot_partial_graphs.py is called, before finally clean_trudag_report.py is executed.

## plot_partial_graphs.py

The python-script [plot_partial_graphs.py](plot_partial_graphs.py) is used to generate a myriad of partial graphs with links amongst them.
These are then used to augment the full graph, which is, due to its size, quite hard to display, in the documentation.
By the means of the links of the items, a more or less \"navigable\" version of the trustable graph is created, which displays a handful of items at a time, only.

# Helper-scripts for offline development

## fetch_json.cpp

The C++ script [fetch_json.cpp](fetch_json.cpp) is used to extract lists of paths to json testsuites from unit-testsuites.cpp, which are then used in testsuite-references. This script is purely used during the manual compilation of the references.

## generate_documentation.sh

The shell-script [generate_documentation.sh](generate_documentation.sh) generates a locally hosted version of the documentation, which is used for testing purposes.

## generate_list_of_tests.py

The python script [generate_list_of_tests.py](generate_list_of_tests.py) is used to generate the [list_of_test_environments.md](../docs/list_of_test_environments.md) listing the expected test-cases with their execution environments.
The file [list_of_test_environments.md](../docs/list_of_test_environments.md) is then persistently stored within the documentation.
Additionally, this script is utilised within the validator ``check_list_of_tests`` to generate a list of test environments from the most recent test results and to compare this list with the persistently stored one.
In case that new tests are added, tests are removed or test environments change, it is therefore necessary to have an accurate list_of_test_environments.md, which is highly recommended to be generated using this script.
To run the script, the database `MemoryEfficientTestResults.db` must be downloaded from the artifact of the most recent successful ubuntu workflow, and placed in the folder `artifacts` in the root of the repository.
Moreover, it must be ensured that this script is run from within the root of the repository, only. 

## generate_subgraph_plots.sh

The shell-script [generate_subgraph_plots.sh](generate_subgraph_plots.sh) is used to generate subgraphs of the trustable graph using trudag plot with the --pick option. 
Since the options of adding custom hyperlinks to the individual nodes of the generated subgraphs are not quite as flexible as desired for the \"navigable\" version of the trustable graph, we opted to use the custom script plot_partial_graphs.py.

# Assessment of Third-Party Tools Used in nlohmann/json

This file provides an assessment of all third-party tools used in the development, testing, and documentation of nlohmann/json version 3.12.0, as required by TA-INPUTS in the Trustable Software Framework (TSF).

**Assessment Date**: November 25, 2025  
**Assessors**: @erikhu1  
**Target nlohmann/json Version**: v3.12.0

## Tool Assessment Summary

### amalgamate.py
- **Role**: Third-party Python script, mirrored into the nlohmann/json repository and is used to generate the single-header distribution file `json.hpp` from the modular source tree.
- **Potential Misbehaviours**: The upstream README (https://github.com/edlund/amalgamate/blob/master/README.md) explicitly states that `amalgamate.py` is "quite dumb" and may produce "weird results" for non-trivial code. In particular, it only understands very simple `#include` directives and does not correctly handle:
  - macro-based includes (e.g. `#define HEADER_PATH "x.h"` / `#include HEADER_PATH`),
  - certain assumptions about file endings (missing final newline, backslash-escaped newline).

   As a result, it could incorrectly merge files (wrong order, missing or duplicated code), fail to include required headers, or corrupt the generated header in subtle ways.
  
   The script originates from an external project that is not under the direct control of the nlohmann/json maintainers and shows limited public maintenance activity.
- **Severity**: High - Any undetected error in the amalgamated header would directly affect the library's functionality.
- **Detectability**: High - The generated `json.hpp` is stored in version control and built in CI, where it is compiled and run with the full unit test suite. This means that most structural or include-related problems show up as build or test failures, and more subtle issues are further reduced by the use of fuzz testing.
- **Mitigation**:
  - The script is mirrored into the repository and thus fully auditable.
  - Compilation tests and unit tests are run on the amalgamated `json.hpp`.
  - Changes to the mirrored script and to the generated `json.hpp` are manually reviewed before releases.
    
### American fuzzy lop (AFL)
- **Role**: Fuzz testing tool used to generate many random and mutated inputs for the library in order to find crashes and hangs.
- **Potential Misbehaviours**: AFL can only explore the parts of the code that are reachable from the chosen fuzz targets and input seeds. It may miss important edge cases or code paths, so existing bugs can remain undiscovered. This can create a false sense of robustness.
- **Severity**: Medium - bugs that are not found by AFL can still reach users, but AFL itself never changes the library code or the released header.
- **Detectability**: Low - missed edge cases are usually only noticed later, for example through other tests, other fuzzers, or bug reports from users.
- **Mitigation**: AFL is only one part of a broader testing strategy. It is complemented by:
  - continuous fuzzing via OSS-Fuzz and libFuzzer,
  - extensive unit tests with a 100% coverage target,
  - dynamic analysis with tools such as Valgrind.  


### AppVeyor
- **Role**: Continuous integration service used to build and test the library on Windows.
- **Potential Misbehaviours**: AppVeyor itself can fail (e.g. service outages, misconfigured jobs, flaky Windows images), which can lead to:
  - build failures that are unrelated to the code,
  - tests not running or reporting wrong results,
  - Windows-specific issues not being exercised properly.
- **Severity**: Medium - if Windows CI is broken or misconfigured, Windows-specific problems might not be detected, but the source code and `json.hpp` are not modified by AppVeyor.
- **Detectability**: High - CI results are visible for every commit and pull request, and unexpected failures or missing runs are noticed by maintainers. Suspicious results can be cross-checked with local Windows builds. Any misbehaviours can also be reported by the users.
- **Mitigation**: Multiple CI platforms (GitHub Actions, Cirrus CI), cross-platform testing

### Artistic Style
- **Role**:  Tool used to automatically format and indent the C++ source code.
- **Potential Misbehaviours**: Artistic Style can change whitespace and line breaks in a way that makes the code harder to read. In unusual cases or with a wrong configuration, it could also reformat code so that the structure is broken (for example, by changing braces in a way that affects parsing).
- **Severity**: Low - The tool is only used for formatting. if it ever breaks the code, the problem is detected by compilation or tests before a release.
- **Detectability**: High - Formatting changes are visible in code review and any structural problems show up as compiler errors or test failures.
- **Mitigation**:
  - After reformatting, the code is compiled and tested in CI.
  - Non-trivial or suspicious formatting changes are checked manually during review.

### Clang
- **Role**:  One of the main compilers used to build and test the library. In CI it is also used with sanitizers such as AddressSanitizer and UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer. These sanitizers are special compiler modes that make the program crash with a clear error message when it does things like reading/writing invalid memory or relying on undefined behaviour, so such bugs are easier to find during testing.
- **Potential Misbehaviours**: Clang itself, or its sanitizers, can have bugs. This can lead to:
  - wrong binary code being generated,
  - some memory or undefined-behaviour problems not being detected,
  - false reports that claim there is a problem when there is none.  
- **Severity**: High - If Clang or its sanitizers miss real issues, tests can still pass even though bugs are present. This reduces confidence in the test results.
- **Detectability**: Medium - problems that only appear with one compiler are partly caught by:
  - also building and testing with other compilers (e.g. GCC, MSVC) and
  - bug reports from users who build with different toolchains.  
- **Mitigation**:
  - The library is built and tested with multiple compilers and versions in CI (Clang, GCC, MSVC).
  - Static analysis tools (e.g. Coverity, cppcheck, Codacy) and dynamic tools (sanitizers, Valgrind) are used in addition to normal compilation and unit tests, which increases the chance of finding real issues even if one compiler or sanitizer misses them.

### CMake
- **Role**:  Primary build system generator used to configure how the library's internal targets are built on different platforms. CMake reads the project’s `CMakeLists.txt` files and generates platform-specific build files (e.g. Makefiles, Ninja files, Visual Studio projects) that control the compilation and linking of the unit test and optional helper tools (e.g. sanitizer), including the selection of compilers and the compiler flags used.
- **Potential Misbehaviours**: CMake can be misconfigured or behave differently between versions, which can lead to:
  - wrong or incomplete build configurations (e.g. tests not being built or run),
  - missing or incorrectly detected dependencies and features,
  - wrong compiler or linker flags (e.g. no debug info, missing warnings, wrong standard version).  
  In such cases, the code itself may be correct, but the way it is built and tested is not what the developers expect.
- **Severity**: High - If CMake generates a wrong build configuration, all builds that rely on it can be affected
- **Detectability**: High - most CMake-related problems show up as:
  - build failures in CI or on user systems,
  - obviously missing targets,
  - inconsistent results between different platforms or compilers.  
  Such issues are usually noticed quickly when running builds on multiple systems.
- **Mitigation**:
  - The root `CMakeLists.txt` in the nlohmann/json repository declares a minimum required CMake version (via `cmake_minimum_required(...)`), so too old or unsupported CMake versions are rejected at configure time rather than producing silently broken build files.
  - The CMake-based build configuration is exercised in continuous integration on multiple platforms and compilers (Linux, macOS, Windows with Clang, GCC, and MSVC), as documented on the project's “Quality assurance” page (https://json.nlohmann.me/community/quality_assurance/?utm_source=chatgpt.com#simple-integration).
  - The same CMake setup is used to configure and build the internal unit tests (via `enable_testing()` / `add_subdirectory(test)` in `CMakeLists.txt`) and the small example/demo programs described in the documentation, so incorrect build options or missing dependencies usually cause test or example targets to fail.
  - All changes to the CMake files are tracked in version control and go through pull-request review. They must pass the full CI matrix before being merged, which reduces the risk that a broken CMake configuration is used for a release.

### Codacy
- **Role**: Codacy is a hosted code quality and static analysis service that is connected to the nlohmann/json repository. It automatically analyzes new commits and pull requests with various C++ linters and rules, and then reports findings such as style issues, potential bugs, complexity problems, and code smells in a web dashboard and as comments on pull requests.
- **Potential Misbehaviours**: Codacy can:
  - report false positives,
  - miss real issues (false negatives),
  - change its rules or analyzers over time, so that the same code can produce different warnings at different points in time even if the project itself has not changed.  
- **Severity**: Low - Codacy is purely informational. It does not modify any code.
- **Detectability**: High - Codacy's findings are visible alongside results from other tools (e.g. Coverity, cppcheck, compiler warnings), and discrepancies or obviously wrong reports are easy to spot during code review.
- **Mitigation**: Multiple static analysis tools (Coverity, cppcheck, clang-tidy) and manual code review.

### Coveralls
- **Role**: Coveralls is a hosted service for code coverage measurement and reporting. In the nlohmann/json project, coverage data produced during the Ubuntu CI workflow is uploaded to Coveralls from the GitHub Actions workflow `.github/workflows/ubuntu.yml` using the `coverallsapp/github-action` step (“Publish report to Coveralls”). The resulting coverage information is shown on the project's Coveralls page and is linked as a badge in the README.
- **Potential Misbehaviours**: Coveralls can:
  - display incorrect coverage percentages or mark lines as covered/uncovered incorrectly,
  - lose or mix up coverage history, which can make trends look better or worse than they are,
  - be temporarily unavailable.  
- **Severity**: Medium - Misleading coverage information can cause important parts of the code to remain untested, even when the coverage dashboard looks “green”.
- **Detectability**: Medium - Inconsistencies can be compared against local coverage runs. 
- **Mitigation**:
  - Coverage is also generated locally and in CI using `lcov` and viewed as HTML reports, so Coveralls results can be cross-checked against these local reports.

### clang-tidy
- **Role**: Clang-Tidy is used as static analysis tool to detect bug patterns, unsafe constructs, and style/performance issues in the code base. In nlohmann/json it is explicitly part of the project’s “Static analysis” quality assurance activities, and it is configured via a repository-wide [.clang-tidy](https://github.com/nlohmann/json/blob/develop/.clang-tidy) configuration file.
- **Potential Misbehaviours**: 
  - False positives (reporting issues that are not real problems) or false negatives (missing real issues).
  - Results can vary between Clang-Tidy versions and depending on compile flags / include paths.
- **Severity**: Medium - Clang-Tidy findings are advisory and incorrect or missing findings can reduce confidence and leave issues undiscovered, but the tool does not modify shipped artefacts by itself.
- **Detectability**: Medium - False positives are usually spotted during review and false negatives are harder to detect and may only surface through other analyzers, tests, fuzzing, or user reports.
- **Mitigation**: 
  - Clang-Tidy is not the only analysis gate, results are complemented by other static analyzers (e.g. cppcheck, Coverity, Clang Static Analyzer) and dynamic testing (unit tests, fuzzing, sanitizers). 
  - The .clang-tidy configuration is version-controlled and reviewed like normal code changes. 
  - CI uses a controlled toolchain environment (e.g. the project CI image), reducing version drift and improving reproducibility.

### Coverity Scan
- **Role**: Coverity Scan is a hosted static analysis service that regularly analyzes the nlohmann/json code base for potential defects. The nlohmann/json repo has a dedicated Coverity Scan entry (linked via the “Coverity Scan Build Status” badge in `README.md`), where findings are listed and tracked in a web dashboard.
- **Potential Misbehaviours**: Could miss bugs (false negatives) or report non-issues (false positives)
- **Severity**: Medium - Missed bugs or misinterpreted reports can affect the quality of the library.
- **Detectability**: High - Coverity Scan findings are compared with results from other static analyzers (such as cppcheck and Codacy), compiler warnings, and the behaviour observed in tests and fuzzing. 
- **Mitigation**: 
  - Multiple static analyzers (cppcheck, clang-tidy, Codacy), extensive testing. 
  - Coverity Scan is used within S-CORE, where tool qualification evidence is maintained.

### cppcheck
- **Role**: Cppcheck is a static analysis tool for C++ that is used to scan the nlohmann/json library code base for potential problems such as null dereferences, uninitialized variables, dead code, or suspicious constructs.
- **Potential Misbehaviours**: False positives could waste developer time, false negatives could miss bugs.
- **Severity**: Medium - Missed issues (false negatives) can affect users if they are not caught by other tools or tests. However, its output is advisory, and problems only enter the code base if humans misinterpret or ignore the results.
- **Detectability**: High - Cppcheck's findings are viewed together with other static analyzers (such as Coverity and Codacy), compiler warnings from different compilers and the behaviour observed in unit tests and fuzzing.  
- **Mitigation**: Multiple static analysis tools (Coverity, clang-tidy), compiler warnings enabled, extensive unit tests.

### doctest
- **Role**: Doctest is the C++ open source unit testing framework used by nlohmann/json for its internal test suite. The project’s unit tests are implemented in source files under `tests/src/` (for example `tests/src/unit-*.cpp`), where test cases are written using doctest macros such as `TEST_CASE`, `CHECK`, and `REQUIRE`.
- **Potential Misbehaviours**: Doctest itself can have bugs or limitations. This can lead to situations of:
  - false passes, for example if an assertion macro does not correctly detect a failing condition or if failures are swallowed by the framework,
  - false failures, for example due to issues with test registration, command-line handling, or interaction with specific compilers and optimisation levels,
  - some test cases are never discovered or executed (for example if certain `TEST_CASE` definitions are not registered correctly in some build configurations).  
- **Severity**: High - The doctest-based unit tests are a key mechanism for ensuring correctness of the library before changes are merged or releases are made. If doctest hides real failures or silently skips tests, bugs can remain undetected and be shipped to users. 
- **Detectability**: High - Framework problems are partly detectable because the same doctest-based test suite is compiled and executed with multiple compilers (such as Clang, GCC, and MSVC) and on different platforms, so framework or configuration issues often show up as differences between environments or as unexpected crashes in the test binaries.
- **Mitigation**:
  - The doctest-based tests are run in a broad CI matrix (different operating systems, compilers, and standard libraries), which helps reveal framework or configuration issues that only appear under certain toolchains.
  - For critical functionality and previously fixed defects, test coverage is reinforced by additional checks such as fuzzing, sanitizer runs, and targeted manual tests.
  - When a discrepancy is suspected, new test cases are added or existing ones are refined, improving both test coverage and the chance to notice framework-related issues.
  - All changes to the tests or to the way doctest is integrated (e.g. via CMake) go through normal pull requests, are reviewed by maintainers, and must pass the full CI test matrix.

### GitHub Changelog Generator
- **Role**: GitHub Changelog Generator is a tool that uses the GitHub API to collect issues, pull requests, and tags from the nlohmann/json repository and then generates a `ChangeLog.md` file from this information. It is used to create a human-readable list of changes for releases.
- **Potential Misbehaviours**: The tool can miss entries, include wrong or misleading information or produce poorly formatted output (e.g. broken Markdown or duplicated entries).  
- **Severity**: Low - Even if the generated changelog is incomplete or inaccurate, this only affects documentation and release notes. It does not change the any code of the library or its functionality.
- **Detectability**: High - Incorrect or missing entries, odd wording, or broken formatting in `ChangeLog.md` are usually easy to spot when maintainers review the file before a release. Users may also report inconsistencies if they notice them.
- **Mitigation**:
  - The generated `ChangeLog.md` is committed to version control and reviewed and edited manually by maintainers before a release.
  - If the generator's configuration leads to repeated problems (e.g. systematically missing certain types of issues), the configuration or the generation process can be adjusted, and older changelog entries can be corrected in the repository.
  - Because the changelog is under version control, any mistakes can be fixed later, and the history of changes to `ChangeLog.md` is traceable.
    
### Google Benchmark
- **Role**: Google Benchmark is a C++ microbenchmarking framework used in nlohmann/json to implement standalone performance benchmarks for the library. The benchmark program in `tests/benchmarks/src/benchmarks.cpp` uses the Google Benchmark API to measure operations such as `json::parse`, `dump`, and conversions to binary formats (e.g. CBOR) on representative JSON files, so maintainers can track performance and detect regressions between versions.
- **Potential Misbehaviours**:  Google Benchmark can:
  - produce noisy or misleading measurements if the environment is unstable (e.g. different CPUs, background load, power-saving modes),
  - encourage microbenchmarks that are not representative of real-world usage, leading to optimizations that improve benchmark numbers but not actual user workloads,
  - be misconfigured, which can bias results or exaggerate small differences.  
- **Severity**: Low - Incorrect or misleading benchmark results can waste time or lead to suboptimal performance decisions, but they do not affect the functional correctness or safety of the library.
- **Detectability**: High - suspicious benchmark results can usually be identified by rerunning the benchmarks on the same and on different machines and by comparing results across compilers, optimization levels, and configurations. 
- **Mitigation**:
  - Performance changes suggested by Google Benchmark results are not accepted blindly, maintainers manually interpret the data and consider how realistic the benchmarked scenarios are for typical users.
  - Functional tests and fuzzing remain the primary gate for correctness.
    
### Hedley
- **Role**: Hedley is a third-party header that provides portability and feature-detection macros for different compilers and platforms. nlohmann/json ships a bundled copy in `include/nlohmann/thirdparty/hedley/hedley.hpp`, which is included from `json.hpp` and used to define macros for attributes, warning suppression, and compiler feature checks.  
- **Potential Misbehaviours**: Wrong or incomplete Hedley macros can:
  - assume compiler features or attributes that are not actually supported,
  - trigger compilation errors or excessive warnings on some compilers,
  - silently disable useful attributes or diagnostics, which may lead to performance issues or missed warnings.
- **Severity**: High - Hedley is used throughout the headers and affects how the library is compiled on all platforms. Incorrect macros can break builds or cause subtle differences in behaviour across compilers.
- **Detectability**: High - most problems show up as build failures or unusual warnings on specific compilers or platforms, and are likely to be caught by the project's CI matrix.
- **Mitigation**:
  - A specific version of Hedley is used in the nlohman/json repository and is fully under version control and updates are done via pull requests and must pass all CI checks before being included in a release 
  - The library is built and tested with multiple compilers (Clang, GCC, MSVC) and on multiple platforms in CI.
 
### lcov
- **Role**: lcov is used in the nlohmann/json project as part of the coverage setup introduced together with the CMake-based build system (see 'Added CMake and lcov' in the project's changelog and PR #6). It processes gcov output from the doctest-based unit tests to generate local HTML reports, which can be cross-checked against the coverage information published via Coveralls.
- **Potential Misbehaviours**: lcov can misinterpret or partially ignore `gcov` data, so that some lines are shown as covered or uncovered incorrectly and generate incomplete or inconsistent HTML reports.
- **Severity**: Low - lcov only reads coverage data and creates reports; it does not affect any code or the functionality of the lirary. 
- **Detectability**: High - Inconsistencies can be detected by comparing lcov's HTML output with the coverage data uploaded to Coveralls.
- **Mitigation**: 
  - Mitigation through cross-validation with Coveralls and manual inspection of coverage data. 
  - lcov is used within S-CORE, where tool qualification evidence is maintained.

### libFuzzer
- **Role**: libFuzzer is LLVM's fuzzing engine that runs inside the test binary and uses code-coverage feedback to generate new inputs. In nlohmann/json it is used as the fuzzing backend for the fuzz harnesses under `tests/src/` (e.g. `fuzzer-parse_json.cpp`), each implementing `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput` and calling APIs such as `json::parse` and the `from_*` functions for CBOR, MessagePack, UBJSON, and BJData. The same libFuzzer-based targets are also built and run by Google OSS-Fuzz, which executes them continuously with sanitizers to find crashes and undefined behaviour.
- **Potential Misbehaviours**: libFuzzer can only explore code that is reachable through the fuzz harness and within the time and resources it is given, so it can miss important edge cases or provide misleading coverage.
- **Severity**: Medium - Bugs that are not found by libFuzzer (false negatives) can still reach users if they are not caught by other fuzzers, tests, or reviews.
- **Detectability**: Low - Missed edge cases are they are typically discovered later through other fuzzers, unit and regression tests, or bug reports from users.
- **Mitigation**:
  - libFuzzer is used together with other fuzzing approaches (AFL, OSS-Fuzz,..).
  - Crashes and sanitizer findings from fuzzing are treated as defects and, where applicable, fixed and accompanied by additional regression tests.
  - High unit-test coverage.

### Material for MkDocs
- **Role**: The third-party theme used by the mkdocs-based documentation of nlohmann/json. The documentation sources live under `docs/mkdocs` and are built with MkDocs to produce the public site at &lt;https://json.nlohmann.me&gt;. The theme controls the visual appearance, navigation, and layout of this site.
- **Potential Misbehaviours**: Visual issues, broken layouts, accessibility problems
- **Severity**: Low - Problems in the theme can make the documentation harder to read or navigate, but they do not change the library sources.
- **Detectability**: High - Visual or layout issues are usually easy to spot when viewing the documentation site during local builds or on the deployed site, and users can report any problems they encounter.
- **Mitigation**:
  - The documentation is built and viewed locally during development (following the documented Contributing Guidlines).
  - The site can be checked in multiple browsers and on different devices to catch theme-related layout or responsiveness problems.
  - The mkdocs and Material for MkDocs versions used in `docs/mkdocs` are pinned and updated via pull requests, which are reviewed and must pass CI before being merged.

### MkDocs
- **Role**: MkDocs is the static site generator used to build the nlohmann/json documentation at &lt;https://json.nlohmann.me&gt;, using sources in `docs/mkdocs/docs` and the configuration in `docs/mkdocs/mkdocs.yml`. Maintainers build and preview the site locally with `make install_venv -C docs/mkdocs` and `make serve -C docs/mkdocs`, and the same MkDocs setup is also run in CI to build the documentation.
- **Potential Misbehaviours**: MkDocs could fail to build the documentation (for example due to configuration or plugin issues), generate pages with broken links or missing sections, or render Markdown in a way that causes formatting or navigation problems.
- **Severity**: Low - Even if the documentation is incomplete or incorrectly rendered, this only affects the documentation site. MkDocs does not modify the library sources.
- **Detectability**: High - Build failures are immediately visible when running the MkDocs commands locally or in CI, and visual or navigation issues can be spotted when reviewing the rendered site.
- **Mitigation**:
  - The documentation is built and viewed locally during development, so maintainers can manually review the generated pages before changes are published.
  - The MkDocs configuration and its dependencies (including the theme and plugins) are kept under version control in `docs/mkdocs`, and updates are applied via pull requests.
  - Broken links or formatting problems reported by users can be fixed by updating the Markdown sources or the MkDocs configuration, with all changes tracked and reviewed like normal code changes.

### OSS-Fuzz
- **Role**: OSS-Fuzz is Google's hosted service for continuous fuzzing of open-source projects. nlohmann/json is enrolled there as the `json` project, where OSS-Fuzz builds the repository together with its libFuzzer-based fuzz harnesses under `tests/src/` (e.g. `fuzzer-parse_json.cpp`, `fuzzer-parse_cbor.cpp`,..`) and runs the resulting fuzzers continuously with various sanitizer configurations against all supported parsers. The integration is documented in the project's documentation/README, and several GitHub issues (e.g. [#389](https://github.com/nlohmann/json/issues/389), [#409](https://github.com/nlohmann/json/issues/409), [#452](https://github.com/nlohmann/json/issues/452)) show concrete bugs that were reported by OSS-Fuzz and then fixed in the library.
- **Potential Misbehaviours**: OSS-Fuzz can experience service outages or build/configuration issues, meaning that fuzzing temporarily stops or some fuzz targets are not executed as expected. It can also report false positives, which may consume maintainer time, while still missing other edge cases that do not get reached by the current fuzz setup.
- **Severity**: Medium - Continuous fuzzing from OSS-Fuzz is an important safety net for catching parser bugs and undefined behaviour over time. If it stops working or misses certain paths, bugs may remain undetected longer, but OSS-Fuzz itself never modifies the source code or the shipped `json.hpp`.
- **Detectability**: Medium - problems with OSS-Fuzz (such as build failures or missing runs) are visible on the OSS-Fuzz project dashboards and through email notifications, but the absence of new reports does not guarantee the absence of bugs.
- **Mitigation**:
  - The same fuzz harnesses used by OSS-Fuzz can also be built and run locally (with libFuzzer or AFL).
  - Fuzzing is complemented by extensive unit tests with high coverage, sanitizer builds, and manual review of critical parsing and binary-format code.
  - Crashes and sanitizer findings reported by OSS-Fuzz are treated as defects and, where applicable, fixed and covered by regression tests.


### Probot
- **Role**: Probot is a framework for GitHub Apps that automate repository workflows. In the nlohmann/json repo it is configured via `.github/config.yml` to use apps such as Sentiment Bot and Request Info. These bots post automated comments on issues and pull requests, for example reminding users of the Code of Conduct or asking for more information. Their behaviour can be seen in GitHub issues where `@sentiment-bot` has commented.
- **Potential Misbehaviours**: Probot-based apps can misclassify comments as toxic and respond inappropriately, repeatedly ask for more information on already well-described issues, or automatically label and close issues that are in fact valid. Such behaviour can confuse contributors or temporarily hide relevant discussions, but it only affects issue and PR handling on GitHub.
- **Severity**: Low - Probot automation influences how issues and pull requests are managed, not how the library is built or executed.
- **Detectability**: High - All Probot actions appear as comments, labels, or status changes in the GitHub UI, so misbehaviour is visible to maintainers and contributors.
- **Mitigation**:
  - The Probot configuration in `.github/config.yml` is under control and can be adjusted or reverted via pull requests if a bot behaves undesirably.
  - Maintainers monitor issue and PR activity and can reopen, relabel, or manually respond to threads that were mishandled by automation.
  - If a Probot app causes persistent problems, it can be disabled or its scope reduced without impacting the library code or release process.

### Valgrind
- **Role**: Valgrind is a runtime analysis tool used in nlohmann/json to run the test binaries under a memory checker in order to detect leaks and invalid memory accesses. According to the quality assurance documentation and the CMake setup, the test suite can be executed under Valgrind via the `JSON_Valgrind` CMake option, which configures CTest to run the tests with Valgrind and to treat reported memory errors as test failures (using options such as `--leak-check=full` and a non-zero `--error-exitcode`).
- **Potential Misbehaviours**: Valgrind can miss some memory errors or report false positives. It also slows down execution significantly, so runs may use smaller inputs or be executed less frequently.
- **Severity**: High - Memory errors, invalid accesses, or leaks are critical, and if Valgrind fails to reveal them and they are not caught by other tools, they can affect applications using nlohmann/json.
- **Detectability**: High - Valgrind's limitations are partly mitigated because the same test suite is also run with compiler sanitizers (e.g. AddressSanitizer).
- **Mitigation**:
  - Valgrind is used alongside compiler sanitizers, fuzzing (including OSS-Fuzz), and a high-coverage unit test suite.
  - Memory related findings from Valgrind or sanitizers are treated as defects and, where appropriate, fixed and covered by regression tests.

## Assessment Methodology

Each tool was evaluated based on:

1. **Role in Release Process**: How the tool contributes to building, testing, or documenting nlohmann/json
2. **Potential Misbehaviours**: Ways the tool could malfunction or produce incorrect results
3. **Impact Assessment**:
   - **Severity**: Impact on library correctness, safety, or usability (Low/Medium/High)
   - **Detectability**: Likelihood that misbehaviour would be caught by other tools or processes (Low/Medium/High)
4. **Mitigation Measures**: Existing safeguards that reduce risk from tool misbehaviour

## Risk Categorization

The highest-severity tools are those that directly affect the build and test artefact, namely amalgamate.py, CMake, Hedley, Clang and doctest, while the fuzzing tools AFL, libFuzzer and OSS-Fuzz are assessed as medium severity with low detectability, and the documentation and automation tools (such as MkDocs, Material for MkDocs, GitHub Changelog Generator and Probot) are considered low severity because they do not influence the library's behaviour.

| Tool                       | Severity | Detectability |
|----------------------------|----------|---------------|
| amalgamate.py              | High     | High          |
| CMake                      | High     | High          |
| Hedley                     | High     | High          |
| doctest                    | High     | High          |
| Clang                      | High     | Medium        |
| Coverity Scan              | Medium   | High          |
| cppcheck                   | Medium   | High          |
| AppVeyor                   | Medium   | High          |
| Coveralls                  | Medium   | Medium        |
| clang-tidy                 | Medium   | Medium        |
| AFL                        | Medium   | Low           |
| libFuzzer                  | Medium   | Low           |
| OSS-Fuzz                   | Medium   | Low           |
| MkDocs                     | Low      | High          |
| Material for MkDocs        | Low      | High          |
| GitHub Changelog Generator | Low      | High          |
| Probot                     | Low      | High          |
| Google Benchmark           | Low      | High          |
| lcov                       | Low      | High          |
| Codacy                     | Low      | High          |


## Conclusion

The nlohmann/json project employs a multi validation strategy with multiple redundant tools for critical functions (testing, analysis, memory checking). High-severity tools are well-qualified through extensive CI testing, cross-validation, and manual review processes. The risk from tool misbehaviour is assessed as **LOW** due to comprehensive mitigation measures.

# Non-Reproducible Tests in nlohmann/json

## Overview

The nlohmann/json test suite includes 8 CMake integration tests (comprising 10 individual test executions) that are labeled as `not_reproducible`. These tests verify different methods of consuming the library in CMake-based projects but create build artifacts with timestamps and cached state that prevent bit-for-bit reproducible builds.

The non-reproducibility of all these tests is reasonable and justified.

These can be identified and found by searching for "LABELS not_reproducible" in the project.

## The 8 Non-Reproducible CMake Integration Tests

### 1. cmake_import (2 tests)

**Location:** `tests/cmake_import/`

**Test Names:**
- `cmake_import_configure`
- `cmake_import_build`

**What it tests:**
Verifies that the library can be found and used via CMake's `find_package(nlohmann_json)` mechanism after installation. This simulates how end users would consume an installed version of the library.

**Why non-reproducible:**
- Requires `JSON_Install=ON` to generate CMake config files (`nlohmann_jsonConfig.cmake`)
- Uses `find_package()` which searches for and reads installed CMake configuration files
- Generates CMakeCache.txt with absolute paths and timestamps in the test build directory
- Creates compiled executables (`with_namespace_target`, `without_namespace_target`) with timestamps
- Multiple runs produce different timestamps on all generated artifacts

---

### 2. cmake_import_minver (2 tests)

**Location:** `tests/cmake_import_minver/`

**Test Names:**
- `cmake_import_minver_configure`
- `cmake_import_minver_build`

**What it tests:**
Similar to `cmake_import`, but specifically tests that CMake's version constraint mechanism works correctly with `find_package(nlohmann_json 3.2.0 REQUIRED)`. Ensures the library properly declares its version in the CMake config files.

**Why non-reproducible:**
- Same reasons as `cmake_import`
- Additionally verifies version metadata in generated config files
- Creates timestamped build artifacts and CMake cache files

---

### 3. cmake_add_subdirectory (2 tests)

**Location:** `tests/cmake_add_subdirectory/`

**Test Names:**
- `cmake_add_subdirectory_configure`
- `cmake_add_subdirectory_build`

**What it tests:**
Verifies that the library can be embedded directly into a CMake project using `add_subdirectory()`. This is the most common integration method for projects that vendor their dependencies.

**Why non-reproducible:**
- Runs a nested CMake configuration in an isolated test directory
- Generates CMakeCache.txt with absolute source/binary paths and timestamps
- Builds multiple executables (`with_namespace_target`, `without_namespace_target`, `without_exceptions`)
- Each build creates object files, executables with embedded timestamps
- Subsequent runs create new artifacts with different timestamps
- CMake's incremental build cache persists between runs, causing different behavior

---

### 4. cmake_target_include_directories (2 tests)

**Location:** `tests/cmake_target_include_directories/`

**Test Names:**
- `cmake_target_include_directories_configure`
- `cmake_target_include_directories_build`

**What it tests:**
Verifies that the library headers can be used via direct `target_include_directories()` calls with both `PRIVATE` and `SYSTEM` variants. Also tests a specific regression from [discussion #2281](https://github.com/nlohmann/json/discussions/2281) regarding transitive include directories.

**Why non-reproducible:**
- Creates a full CMake build with libraries (Foo, Bar) and executables
- Generates CMakeCache.txt with absolute paths to source includes
- All compiled artifacts have timestamps
- Static libraries and executables accumulate with different modification times on each run

---

## Assertions and Reproducibility

Additionally, the nlohmann/json README notes that **assertions must be disabled** for fully reproducible builds (see [discussion #4494](https://github.com/nlohmann/json/discussions/4494)). This is because:

- Assertions often use `__FILE__` which embeds absolute source paths
- Different build machines have different paths
- This embeds environment-specific information into binaries

To ensure reproducible builds, compile with:
```bash
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release  # Typically defines NDEBUG
# or explicitly:
cmake -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS="-DNDEBUG"
```

## Running Reproducible Tests Only

To run only reproducible tests:
```bash
# Exclude non-reproducible tests
ctest -LE not_reproducible

# Exclude both non-reproducible and git-required tests
ctest -LE "not_reproducible|git_required"
```

The project has a dedicated CI target that automatically excludes these tests:
```bash
cmake --build build --target ci_reproducible_tests
```
