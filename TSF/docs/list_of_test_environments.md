## List of all unit-tests with test environments

    This list contains all unit-tests possibly running in this project.
    These tests are compiled from the source-code, where the individual unit-tests are arranged in TEST_CASEs containing possibly nested SECTIONs.
    To reflect the structure of the nested sections, nested lists are utilised, where the top-level list represents the list of TEST_CASEs. 

    It should be noted that not all unit-tests in a test-file are executed with every compiler-configuration.
