In eclipse-score/inc_nlohmann_json, the rate of newly reported misbehaviours or bugs attributable to nlohmann/json (within S-CORE’s use cases) is tracked for each new version integrated. If the rate over a defined observation window exceeds a specified threshold compared to previous versions the affected version is no longer considered a known-good state integration is rolled back to the last known-good version.
